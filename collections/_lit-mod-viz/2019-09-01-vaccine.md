Vaccine hesitancy is not simply a matter of ignorance. Communities around the country are
reluctant to vaccinate for all sorts of reasons: personal, religious, political, medical. By
studying the language of vaccine-related conversations online--using computational
analysis--our team of data and language researchers are revealing the deep seated causes of
vaccine hesitancy, with the hope of improving vaccine messaging and ultimately increasing
uptake.

Language matters. When declaring a "war on drugs," for example, one should not be surprised if
the treatment of addiction becomes militarized, involving further the use of excessive force in
the policing of non-violent offences. Similarly, the framing of vaccine hesitancy in terms of
ignorance further implies an uneducated public, alienating those who have real concerns about
vaccination: in its compliance with Halal or Koshrut restrictions, in matters of healthcare and
labor law, and in its sometimes troubled political history.

Understanding these differing concerns allows public health officials to tailor their
pro-vaccination messaging to the specific sources of hesitancy, based on evidence collected
from millions of conversations online. Matching ways of thinking and communicating ultimately
improves community involvement in vaccination efforts.
