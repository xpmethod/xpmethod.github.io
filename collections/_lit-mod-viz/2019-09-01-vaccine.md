Public outreach around vaccination assumes an implied faith in the efficacy of good science.
Yet, modern vaccine hesitancy has experienced explosive growth, made more acute by the COVID-19
pandemic. In the anticipation of the coming vaccine efforts, we propose to assemble a coalition
of interested parties---vaccine makers, researchers, community leaders, and public health
officials---to re-imagine the medium and the message of public outreach on vaccination. Rather
than intuition, we are guided by data-driven insights into the language and culture of
contemporary "medical choice" movements, using cutting-edge technology such as natural language
processing and machine learning. Together, we aim to increase acceptance by shifting the very
terms of the national conversation. Join us in this campaign to support public health.

## Code Ethics Statement

This code is part of the data collection efforts organized by the Increasing Vaccine Confidence initiative at Columbia University World Projects. Our aim is to analyze the way people talk about vaccination, to better understand the root causes of hesitancy. In doing this, we take precautions to protect the identity of individual posters and commit to publishing our findings as an aggregate, transformed dataset only, normalized and anonymized for statistical-linguistic purposes. We also take reasonable measures to avoid disrupting the normal technical operations of online communities involved, by using public APIs and throttling server requests when possible.

## Call for Participation

The [Literary Modeling and Visualization Workshop][1] at Columbia University is accepting
applications from student participants interested in contributing to its first collaborative
research project, entitled Increasing Covid-19 Vaccine Confidence, led by Professors [Rishi
Goyal][2] (Director of Medicine Literature and Society Program and Assistant Professor of
Medicine) and [Dennis Yi Tenen][3] (Associate Professor, English and Comparative Literature).

As the United States faces challenges to its Covid-19 vaccine rollout, this project
combines expertise in the Medical Humanities and Computational Literary Analysis to understand
the cultural roots of vaccine hesitancy. By investigating the literary tropes surrounding
vaccination in popular press and in medicine, we will seek to explore how science and the
perception of science are continually shaped by metaphors, which persist within the medical
imaginary.

No prior experience in the medical humanities or formal literary analysis is required. We will
be meeting weekly to review relevant literature, explore archives, draft, diagram, code, and
eventually co-author. Students will have the chance to deepen their existing research skills,
as well as to expand into adjacent methods and approaches. 

Contact either of the faculty leads if you are interested in participating.
