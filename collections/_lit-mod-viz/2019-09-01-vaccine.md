Vaccine hesitancy is not simply a matter of ignorance. Communities around the country are
reluctant to vaccinate for all sorts of reasons: personal, religious, political, medical. By
studying the language of vaccine-related conversations online--using computational
analysis--our team of data and language researchers are revealing the deep seated causes of
vaccine hesitancy, with the hope of improving vaccine messaging and ultimately increasing
uptake.

Language matters. When declaring a "war on drugs," for example, one should not be surprised if
the treatment of addiction becomes militarized, involving further the use of excessive force in
the policing of non-violent offences. Similarly, the framing of vaccine hesitancy in terms of
ignorance further implies an uneducated public, alienating those who have real concerns about
vaccination: in its compliance with Halal or Koshrut restrictions, in matters of healthcare and
labor law, and in its sometimes troubled political history.

Understanding these differing concerns allows public health officials to tailor their
pro-vaccination messaging to the specific sources of hesitancy, based on evidence collected
from millions of conversations online. Matching ways of thinking and communicating ultimately
improves community involvement in vaccination efforts.

## Call for Participation

The [Literary Modeling and Visualization Workshop][1] at Columbia University is accepting
applications from student participants interested in contributing to its first collaborative
research project, entitled Increasing Covid-19 Vaccine Confidence, led by Professors [Rishi
Goyal][2] (Director of Medicine Literature and Society Program and Assistant Professor of
Medicine) and [Dennis Yi Tenen][3] (Associate Professor, English and Comparative Literature).

As the United States faces challenges to its Covid-19 vaccine rollout, this project
combines expertise in the Medical Humanities and Computational Literary Analysis to understand
the cultural roots of vaccine hesitancy. By investigating the literary tropes surrounding
vaccination in popular press and in medicine, we will seek to explore how science and the
perception of science are continually shaped by metaphors, which persist within the medical
imaginary.

No prior experience in the medical humanities or formal literary analysis is required. We will
be meeting weekly to review relevant literature, explore archives, draft, diagram, code, and
eventually co-author. Students will have the chance to deepen their existing research skills,
as well as to expand into adjacent methods and approaches.

Contact either of the faculty leads if you are interested in participating.
