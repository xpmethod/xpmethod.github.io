<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

*Literary Modeling and Visualization Workshop* is a research cluster located at the
nexus of narratology, data science, and sociology of literature. We are
particularly interested in advancing formal and exploratory methods for
**computational literary analysis** in dialog with the rich theoretical
traditions of the humanities. Moderated by [Dennis Yi Tenen][dt], Department
of English and Comparative Literature (Columbia University).
