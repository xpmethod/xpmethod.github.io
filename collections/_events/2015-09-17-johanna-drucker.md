## Representation and Non-linear Chronologies

Johanna Drucker, Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies in the
Department of Information Studies at UCLA, will join us for a discussion with
Laura Kurgan, Associate Professor of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation
here at Columbia.

Professor Drucker outlines her concerns:

> I am interested in modeling temporal relations without a standard Cartesian
> grid as the ground, finding a way to realize the unfulfilled project I began
> at \[The University of\] Virginia but couldn't realize because we did not
> have the technical ability. The manuscripts of [Eusebius's
> chronologies,](http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3804) for
> instance, float their relative time scales so they don't have to be
> reconciled within a single metric standard. Other aspects of humanistic
> representation of temporal experience are variable granularity and
> non-continuous temporality. The issues of non-linear, multi-directional,
> non-homogenous, and variably scaled temporalities are ones I have thought
> about for quite awhile.

This conversation will precede Johanna's lecture later in the evening,
["Should Humanists Use Information
Visualizations?"](http://societyoffellows.columbia.edu/events/should-humanists-use-information-visualizations/)
at the Heyman Center for the Humanities.
