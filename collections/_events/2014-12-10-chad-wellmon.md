## On Method: The Humanities in Full: Polemics Against the Two-Culture Fallacy

If the recent diatribes against the digital humanities have done anything, they have
demonstrated how truncated and ahistorical most of our conceptions of the humanities are. We
need a history and vision of the humanities capacious enough to see them not as a particular
method or set of disciplines but as a disposition, as a way of engaging the world. This talk
sketches what such a history might look like and what it might accomplish.

Event is free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served
