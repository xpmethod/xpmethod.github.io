Join the The Center for Data, Media and Society and the Experimental Methods
Group this Friday (Nov 10), from 3-4pm at Butler Studio (208b) for an informal
conversation with Nathan "nash" Sheard, Grassroots Advocacy Organizer at the
Electronic Frontier Foundation. He will introduce the organization's
involvement with issues of online privacy, surveillance, net neutrality,
justice in policing, and access to information. Together, we will talk about
possible projects and local ways to get involved. Hope to see you there!
