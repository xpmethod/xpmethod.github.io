How is masculinity and femininity constructed in Man Pages and Bro Pages?[^1]
What are the discursive travails behind "master/slave" terminology in Sysadmin
circles.[^2] What subjectivity is self-evident to Edward Snowden when he
thinks about "Privacy"? I wish to locate race, gender and power in the
sub-terrains of CS programming and IT infrastructure languages. Why do we
assume that these programming languages, algorithms and applications are free
from bias and prejudice concerning race or gender or sexuality? How would we
go about building a critical archive of such readings? The recent `#Gamergate`
campaign led by video gamers against women who spoke out against sexism in
videogames is but one indication of this phenomenon.
