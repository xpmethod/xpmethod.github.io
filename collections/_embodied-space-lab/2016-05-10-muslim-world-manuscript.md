XPMethod's involvement with MWMP grows out of the work undertaken by us on
Digital Repatriation and Dark Archives. For some of the ideas and conversation
behind that broader impetus, see the first meeting in Mumbai on [free archives
and shadow
libraries](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/knowledge-design-studio/digital-justice.html)
and the second meeting in Lahore on [architectures of
knowledge](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/lahore.html). The first event
for this project is a 3-day conference. You can learn the details
[here](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/events/mwmpconf.html).  

### Aims of the MWMP

* To create a unified catalog for all of these collections, available via OPenn, CLIO, Internet Archive, HathiTrust, and Digital Public Library of America.
* To digitize the approximately 150,000 manuscript pages and make them available for wider scholarly consumption. Under the CLIR Grant, we will have full digitization of 576 manuscripts and 827 paintings/disbound leaves.

### Collection Details

There is a substantial collection of Muslim-world manuscripts housed at Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscripts Library (RBML), the Free Library of Philadelphia and University of Pennysylvania. These manuscripts are in Perso-Arabic or related scripts. Though part of various collections, these manuscripts constitute a "dark" archive, for they are either uncatalogued or only partially catalogued. We aim to catalog, digitize and make them openly available-- in stages.

The collection can be subdivided into six groups: 

#### At Columbia
1. **Smith & Plimpton Collection** Some 600 boxes containing manuscripts. Around 1200 manuscripts deal with "mathematics". David Eugene Smith was a professor of Mathematics at Teachers College, Columbia University (1901-1923). He collected mathematics manuscripts, and his whole collection is held at RBML. Plimpton was a manuscript collector mainly interested in educational manuscripts.
2. **Jeffery Collection** A collection of Qur'anic manuscripts, roughly 50. Arthur Jeffery was a professor of Semitic Languages at Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary. 
3. **X Manuscript Collection** Purchased by or gifted to RBML since the 1930s, most of which are bound books. There are roughly 179 manuscripts, most of which have been poorly catalogued with widely diverging systems of transliteration.
4. **Persian Lithograph Collection** This includes (but is not limited to) Saeed Nafisi's library, purchased in 1960s. The collection is dispersed throughout Butler's shelves, offsite storage, or at RBML itself. Saeed Nafisi was a renowned poet, translator and professor of Persian literature in early-twentieth-century Iran.
5. **The Arabic Papyri Collection** RBML is in possession of an undisclosed papyri collection, which requires investigation and cataloguing.
6. **The Burke Collection** A set of 26 manuscripts in Arabic script. They were probably collected by the missionaries connected to the Union Theological Seminary.

#### At Free Library

1. Anne Baker Lewis, the widow of prominent Philadelphia collector John Frederick Lewis, donated his collection to the Free Library of Philadelphia in 1936. At its heart is a fine selection of Arabic and Persian illuminated manuscripts, along with examples of Coptic, Indo­Persian, Samaritan, Syriac, and Turkish calligraphy, and more than 800 paintings on disbound leaves and cuttings. There are works of astronomy, history, philosophy, religion, law, and literature, including two dozen copies of the Qur’an and eleven of Firdawsi's epic poem, the Shahnama.

#### At University of Pennsylvania Library

1. The University of Pennsylvania’s holdings come from the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University, and date to early 20th century collectors like John Frederick Lewis and Mayer Sulzberger. The majority of these manuscripts are relatively unknown to scholars and include commentaries on the Qur’an, collections of Hadith, Islamic law texts, astrological and magical manuscripts, Persian poetry, and hybrid Arabic­Coptic Christian texts.
