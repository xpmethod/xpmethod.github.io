<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

As scholars, students, and archivists, we would like to imagine---study, build---**knowledge
architectures** that answer to humanistic ideals. Our proximity to the worlds of journalism,
library science, and publishing gives us an opportunity to affect meaningful change in
redressing inequalities of access, to envision the future of books and literacy, and to
experiment with new modalities of human--text interaction.
