Walking can be a mode of analysis that encompasses text, body, and place. The *Embodied Space
Lab* incorporates **mobile methods of reading and map-making** into philology and
historiography. In the dialectic between body and space we trace apparent vectors of power,
technology, gender, class, and ethnicity and draw critical cartographies: ways of seeing and
reflecting on an embodied and embedded world. Moderated by [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira][mp],
(Columbia Libraries).
