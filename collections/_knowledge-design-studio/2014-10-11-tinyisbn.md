TinyISBN is a simple web app that transforms text identifiers like ISBNs into
short, hashtaggable codes, or annotags, suitable for use in microblogging with
services like Twitter. Annotags can be used in conjunction with page numbers
and paragraph numbers to annotate passages of a book or etext. In this way,
decentralized discussion can take place in the virtual margins of a text. The
anatomy of an annotag is simple:

<!-- we cannot strip markdown for summaries, can only strip html -->
<!-- therefore not md tags in the first 75 words -->

The first letter declares the type of the book code to follow--encoded ISBN,
Google Books ID, or OCLC number. The next chracters represent the book or
text, and the characters following the colon are a human-readable notation for
a specific text location. A more complete specification is available on the
[introductory blog post](http://jonreeve.com/projects/annotags/about.html).
