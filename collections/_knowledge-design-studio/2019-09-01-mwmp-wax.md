The MWME builds on the work of the [Muslim World Manuscript
Project](/embodied-space-lab/2016-05-10-mwmp.html).

In this exhibit we focus on the substantial collection of Muslim-world manuscripts housed at
Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscripts Library (RBML). This formerly "dark archive" at Columbia
University is in the process of being digitized and catalogued as part the MWM Project. In this
exhibit we begin the process of interpretation and study of these manuscripts.

The project will develop new ways to incorporate MARCXML records into the production of a Wax
site built on minimal computing principles. In short, the site for the exhibit will be created
with attention and care for readerships in areas of low-bandwidth and other limited forms of
access to computational resources.
