For centuries, the theories and methods of textual scholarship have
presupposed the analog media of ink and paper, but the ever-growing digitality
of today's texts requires us to challenge our assumptions about scholarly
editing, textual scholarship, and publication. This research cluster aims to
reimagine the tools and workflows of digital scholarly editing, with a focus
on sustainability, scalability, and reproducibility. 

### A Digital Critical Edition for the *Vitae Illustrium Virorum* Project 

At the end of the fifteenth century, the Spaniard, Alfonso de Palencia
(1423-1492), chronicler of the Catholic Kings, translated all of Plutarch's
*Parallel Lives* from Latin into Spanish. All these biographies had been
translated since the beginning of the Quattrocento by relevant Italian
humanists from Greek into Latin; Palencia didn't know the Greek language, so
he took advantage of these Latin versions, first published in Rome in 1470. We
know for sure which edition he used to pursue his translation: it was the
third edition published in Venice in 1478 by Nicholas Jenson. In this
Plutarchian corpus there was also a set of biographies written originally in
Latin by several intellectuals: the *Vita Aristotelis* by Leonardo Bruni,
*Vita Platonis* by Guarino Veronese, *Vita Caroli Magni* and *Vitae Hannibalis
et Scipionis* by Donato Acciaiuoli. In an initial phase we plan to digitally
edit these five biographies in the original version and in translation.

This experimental project aims to offer a digital critical edition while
exploring effective ways to present both texts synchronically, but our main
purpose is to create a collaborative infrastructure with a workflow based on
sustainability, collaboration, open source, and reusability.

The prototype is still in its very beginning phase. You can find it here

### The Making and Knowing Project

In the same line, last year Professor Pamela Smith proposed the creation of an
open access critical edition of an early modern "book of secrets" containing
technical recipes and working notes. The key to this project's workflow was
collaboration and scalability in order to integrate grad students lab notes.
