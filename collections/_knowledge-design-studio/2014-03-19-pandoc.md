A series of workshops on authorship using markdown, plain text, and pandoc,
that culminated in an [article for the *Programming
Historian*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown).

Writing, storing, and retrieving documents are activities central to the
humanities research workflow. And yet, many authors base their practice on
proprietary tools and formats that sometimes fall short of even the most basic
requirements of scholarly writing. Perhaps you can relate to being frustrated
by the fragility of footnotes, bibliographies, figures, and book drafts
authored in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. Nevertheless, most journals still
insist on submissions in .docx format.

More than causing personal frustration, this reliance on proprietary tools and
formats has long-term negative implications for the academic community. In
such an environment, journals must outsource typesetting, alienating authors
from the material contexts of publication and adding further unnecessary
barriers to the unfettered circulation of knowledge.
