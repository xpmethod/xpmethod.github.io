**On Method** book series from Columbia University Press publishes concise, provocative
reflections on the process of *doing* research in the humanities. From close reading to
curatorial practice: critical making, mapping, walking, computing, annotating, visualizing,
collecting, or experimenting---on the street, in the lab, or in the archives---the series
presents advanced field practitioners in dialogue with their materials, tools, and techniques.

The editorial collective seeks proposals for book projects of 30,000--50,000 words, which
articulate a single method: explain its history, its possibilities, and limitations. We would
like for our volumes to inspire novice readers as well as to challenge accepted orthodoxies,
addressing a wide audience across disciplines, and representing a rich variety of perspectives
from authors who write with passion about their craft.
