This paper develops a methodology for describing the contents of a controversy
on a microblogging platform (Twitter) by measuring correlations in broad
semantic categories. Over one million tweets were gathered daily from November
2015 to June 2016 using Tweepy and the Twitter API, over 280,000 of which were
not retweets and thus contained unique data. Using a Python implementation of
Roget's hierarchy of semantic categories, these tweets were collected in bins
of one thousand and analyzed using a "bag of categories" model, or
a categorized bag of words. The linear correlation of each category with the
"WOMAN" category was measured and compared with a control group. The categories
concomitant with "WOMAN" in the test corpus include some noise, but as a whole
they present a meaningful description of the conversation that adheres to its
known qualities. This result suggests that a more developed version of this
methodology could be used to detect conversational trends on social media
platforms more easily and with less human labor than other similar methods.
