[No Connect](https://github.com/xpmethod/no-connect) is a template for Jekyll
static site generator that works on a local machine or a USB key, without an
html server. Our template is based on the standard Jekyll theme.

This theme is part of our effort to investigate minimal computing technologies,
and their possible use in humanistic work. Not all forms of scholarship can be
shared on the internet, whether the reason is an unfriendly government or
copyright regimes. Tapping into the affordances of
[Sneakernets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) is one of the ways we
can carve out space for digital work to continue under adverse circumstances.
