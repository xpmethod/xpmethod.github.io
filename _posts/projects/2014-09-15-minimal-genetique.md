Digital editions today range from simple text or html transcriptions of texts, with minimal apparatus (ex. Project Guttenberg) to very elaborate deep explorations of TEI encoded texts (ex. Shelly-Godwin Archive, Bichitra). While the former can be the work of one individual working in isolation, the latter requires a richness of expertise and infrastructure. As a result, the new republic of letters will have to contend with a non-interoperable—and even incommensurable—range of editions; thus we feel the need to pursue an editorial and generational practice that focuses on the training of rising scholars in simple production and transformation scenarios and the power of minimal computing.

In practice, **minimal génétique** consists of a series of exercices around the earliest manuscript of Aimé Césaire's play *Et les chiens se taisaient* aimed at forming hypothetical scenarios, or "deformations," to aid in the genetic reconstruction of the manuscript. In this sense, minimal génétique also refers to the challenge of reconstructing a genetic scenario using only one documentary witness. The process will be documented step-by-step on the project wiki, and hopes to serve as a training module for minimal editors in training, as our sustainable authorship is trying to do for authorship. All files will be housed on Github as a Jekyll site.
