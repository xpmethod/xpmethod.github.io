From Medium to the New York Times app, publishing brands are embracing clean and easy-to-read design. Web designers can optimize the online reading experience to the point of perfection, but some people will always prefer paper.

In this experiment, hackathon attendees will build a protocol to automate the construction of a beautiful, elegantly simple PDFs. Users will be able to download a PDF of each story for a small price (about $1). We believe there are people who will pay for an elegantly typeset PDF.

Readers will be allowed to read online and print out the web version of the story for free. But we have a hunch that the online reading "experience" and what readers value about it is fundamentally different from the paper reading experience. This not only allows readers to build their own physical magazines of our content, but to have the story as an object.
