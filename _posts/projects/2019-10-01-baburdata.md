The [Embodied Space Lab][1] at Columbia University is constructing a
collaborative research dataset of the c16 memoir [_Bāburnāma_][4]. The project is
led by Research Data Librarian [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira][2] and Associate
Professor of History [Manan Ahmed][3]. 

The project aims to build a digital version of version of Annette Beveridge’s
1912–1922 translation of _Bāburnāma_, improving the geospatial data already
collected as part of the earlier XPMethod project “[Mapping Mughal Hindustan,
1500–1600 CE][5].” In addition, the researchers will assemble a rich
collection of datasets around the work, tracking places mentioned, people,
their relationships to each other, and various sentiments, laying the
ground-work for a gazetteer of medieval Central Asia.

Beveridge’s translation is available [for partner institution download from
HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011261317) and, importantly
for our purposes, also [available as a human-edited text file from Project
Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44608), made possible by the
efforts of Barbara Tozier, Turgut Dincer, Bill Tozier, and the [Online
Distributed Proofreading Team](http://www.pgdp.net). 

### Preliminary Research Questions

* How does named entity recognition compare with manual annotation on a twentieth-century translation of a sixteenth-century text?
* What geospatial narrative does Bābur encode in the memoir?
* How turbulent are Bābur’s relationships with other people in the text?
* How does Bābur related to place? Is there a map of “Happy Bābur” and a map
of “Sad Bābur”?

### Phase I (2019–2020)

* Geospatially annotated digital Beveridge translation
* Comparison of manual and computer-driven geospatial entity recognition
* Co-authored publication

### Later Phases

* Biographical annotation
* Network of persons and relations
* API access to datasets
* Reconciliation/synthesis with other editions
