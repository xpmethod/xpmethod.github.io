**Project Goals:**
The aim is to publish a co-authored paper where the various sites of early Mughal Hindustan are re-framed as affective geography.
The secondary aim is release the data-sets for Mughal India on git. Parameters are below. 

1. Aim: To produce a data-set, visualization, and position paper for a DH journal.
2. Data: To extract place-names from three sixteenth century texts. 
The texts are in English and Persian and exist in both print-form and manuscript form. 
Besides place-names, we would also extract qualifiers and descriptors of the place-names. The texts are *Baburnama*, *Humayunnama* and *Akbarnama*. 
*Baburnama* was written in the first two decades of the sixteenth century by Zahiruddin Babur (1483-1530)-- [English edition](http://www.worldcat.org/title/baburnama/oclc/855672100?referer=di&ht=edition) and [Persian edition](http://www.worldcat.org/title/baburnama-baburname-cagatayca-asli-abdurrahim-hanhananin-farsca-tercumesi-ve-ingilizcesi-baburnama-chaghatay-turkish-text-with-abdul-rahim-khankhanans-persian-translation/oclc/862305195?ht=edition&referer=di). *Akbar Nama* and *Humayun Nama* were both compiled in the last decade of the sixteenth century-- the first by Abu'l Fazl and the second by Gulbadan Begum. We will use the [Bilingual Persian-English edition of Akbarnama](http://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-akbar-volume-1/oclc/913097580&referer=brief_results)
and [Akbarnama's Persian edition](http://www.worldcat.org/title/akbar-namah/oclc/20497880&referer=brief_results) and [Humayunnama's Persian Edition](https://www.worldcat.org/title/gulbadannamah/oclc/63181048&referer=brief_result).
3. Visualization: To create a ‘heat’ map for place-names based on frequency of appearances and an ‘affect geography’ map.
4. Timeline & Budget: We aim to have the data-set and site done by May 30, 2017 and the paper submitted to the journal by July, 2017. We have a budget of $5,000 for coding and programming towards the student authors.
