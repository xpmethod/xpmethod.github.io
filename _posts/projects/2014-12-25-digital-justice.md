Free Archives & Shadow Libraries
=================================

Responding to President Bollinger's call to expand the campus conversation
about Equal Justice, this proposal, *Architectures of Knowledge*, harnesses the
emerging field of Digital Humanities towards critically engaging with
questions of digital publics, epistemic regimes, and knowledge architectures.
To these ends, we have organized an international meeting of researchers,
librarians, and activists that addresses equitable distribution of information
globally.  Events held in Mumbai, India July 4th-6th. Organized by Columbia
University in cooperation with Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, Center for
International History, TISS, Leuphana University, CAMP, Multimedia Institute,
and others.

We are inviting you to participate in a two day workshop at TISS Mumbai to be
held July 4-6th, 2016. The workshop will bring together activists, scholars,
artists, and librarians concerned with global inequalities facing knowledge
work. These manifest in the aggregation of material and scientific archives in
northern Europe and America; the pay-walls constructed by the corporate
publishing industry; and the amassing of digital labor in the Global South
while the prestige economy remains in the Global North. In this meeting, we
will investigate technological and artistic practices of epistemic action,
build alliances across borders and economies, share notes, and outline
possibilities for further concerted action.
