SUBJECT: Making the Mold Casting
* Conditions:
** Lab conditions, approx. 72°, no air movement, average humidity.
* Materials:
** Sand from Old Molds: The sand that was used was made from old molds supplied by Dr. Beentjes and Dr. Smith. The original molds varied in density from very corse and hard to fine and soft. After the molds were ground in a mortar with a pestle, they were sifted with a stainless steel sifter, that, as will be illustrated above, proved to be not sifted finely enough.
** Sal ammoniac water: A mixture of sal ammoniac and water as specified in the recipe.
** Brandy: Cheap brandy from the liquor store. [Get the brand name].
** Wooden flask: Pre-made wooden flask to hold sand and mold.
** Molding Clay: Commercially available. I
** Plaster of Paris: <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Commercially available.</span>
* Equipment:
** Mallet and Expresso Pounder: Weight mallet and Expresso pounder
** Mixing Bowl:
** Counter-Top:
** Large Cutting-Knife:
** Wax Carving Tools:
* Primary Recipe:
** 118v - Casting in a box mold
* Discussion on Procedure (10 Oct 14):
** After some last minute detailing, the wax was pressed, face down, into the molding clay and removed shortly there after. During removal of the wax from the clay, in perpetration for plaster pouring, pieces of the wax mold broke off, partially due to improper molding of the wax portions to the medallions base and due to the thinness of the medallion itself.
** The molded clay was then filled with plaster of paris and left overnight to dry over the weekend.

* Discussion on Procedure (14 Oct 14):
** At approximately 0900 the plaster mold was removed from the clay. The mold itself required additional work to bring out the detail as some of the features were distorted by the pressing of the wax into the clay and the warping of the clay itself as the wax was removed.
** The most labor intensive part of the casting then began: the mixing of the sand. 3 and ½ cups of reclaimed sand from old molds were sifted and added to a mixing bowl. The recipe call for a mixture of sal ammoniac ("the size of two walnuts") and water ("the size of a bottle in which one boils ground barley"). Based upon feedback from other groups who were working around us, 1 ½ cups of this sal ammoniac water were added along with two silver spoonfuls of brandy.
** Emily and I commenced blending together the ingredients. Mixing for about 10 mins produced a clumpy and dry mixture. We added another ⅔ of a cup of sal ammoniac water kept on mixing. The mixture became noticeably darker with the addition of more water.
** We then added another ½ cup of sal ammoniac water and Emily noticed that the mixture was getting harder to mix. This may have been due to the binding of the sand or fatigue.
** I (Jef) took over mixing that tried to use the spoon to press larger clumps of the sand against the side of the bowl.
** Tony informed us that the mixture looked too wet so we started to add more sand in order to get the dryness back. We added ½ cup of sand and continued to mix.<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:IMG_1643.jpg width="146" height="194"]][[image:IMG_1642.jpg width="150"]]</span>
** The spoon quickly became tedious was discarded for mixing with my hands. Fingers are more efficient tools for breaking up the clumps that formed in the dirt. Eventually the mixture was judged to be dry enough to be placed in the box mold.

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:IMG_1644.jpg width="151"]][[image:IMG_1646.jpg width="151"]]</span>
** <span style="display: block; text-align: left;">We dusted the face of the medallion with ground vine charcoal and placed it float on the counter in the center of the female portion of the flask and filled it slowly with sand. The back of the plaster medallion was not completely flush with the surface of the counter and this gave me cause for concern. I knew that the mold had broken in the clay earlier and I was worried this would happen again. When we filled the mold with sand the we had to press it firmly on to the medallion, but we tried to take care that this was not enough to break the plaster mold.</span>
** <span style="display: block; text-align: left;">We packed the mold with sand and used the mallet and the espresso pounder to even it out. The excess was removed with a knife and an improvised leveling tool (pictured below in the bottom third of the photo) and returned to the mixing bowl. During the process of pounding and scraping, a relatively large amount of water was emerging from the sand. We believe that this is due to water that was trapped in the sand succumbing to the pounding.</span>


[[image:IMG_1648.jpg width="125" align="center"]]
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
** <span style="display: block; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;">We were again advised by Tony that the mixture was too wet and we added more dry sand to the outside of the mold to draw out the moisture. </span>
</span>
[[image:IMG_1647.jpg width="122" align="center"]]
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
** <span style="display: block; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5; text-align: left;">Once this was completed the mold was lifted from the counter with a twisting motion in the hopes of cleanly releasing the medallion and the sand. This proved to be successful. At Tony's direction, small amount of the sand around the edge of the medallion was removed to aid in removing the plaster cast of the medallion later. The sand surrounding the medallion was then dusted with another thin layer of ground charcoal. </span>
</span>
[[image:IMG_1652.jpg width="133" height="176" align="center"]]


** The male portion of the flask was set in place and the remainder of the mold was filled with sand. When the mold was almost full we found that we did not have enough sand. More sand was mixed, in haste, as the lab had to close in a short amount of time. The takeaway is that estimating the amount of sand required to fill the molds is deceptive. It is better to over estimate how much sand you need. A small mold can hold a lot of sand, even though it looks like it cannot. The mold was pounded and shaved and placed in the vapor hood to allow it to dry.
* Discussion on Procedure (14 Oct 14)
** At approximately 1030, I arrived at the lab and found that my medallion had already been removed from its mold. I unfortunetly was not there to record the procedure, but I was informed that it had broken upon removal.

[[image:IMG_1653.jpg width="247" height="327" align="center"]]

** I could not tell if the image was distorted. The granular nature of the sand and its texture really obscured the image from the eye. I thought about what Dr. Smith had told us about her past experiences with molding, that being that molds often do not look like they have held the detail but turn out that they have. I hoped that this was true in our case. After inspecting the mold they were packed in boxes to be carried to the workshop the next day. 
** When I went to make the mold for Emily's medallion, I discovered that we were out of sand. Under Tony's instruction I utilized modern commercial sand. The intention of this was to provide a type of control for the other experiments and provide some contrast as to how sand can and does behave. 
** Working with the commercial sand was simple and direct. It was firm when packed and malleable when lose. The oil in the sand left very little residue on hands and tools, yet held the sand together enough that it could be packed. It took the impression of the medallion almost flawlessly, and released the plaster casting very easily. The sand was finely ground, way more finely ground than our EM sand. 
** The time it took to make the mold was significantly less as well. The mold was packed in the same manner are the medallion above and ground vine charcoal was used as a separation agent.

NAME: Jef Palframan
DATE AND TIME: 051100 Oct 14
LOCATION: Brooklyn, NY - Apartment on 20th floor
SUBJECT: Sculpting Wax for Sand Casting
* Conditions:
** When I started molding the wax at 1100 the temperature in the room was approx. 70°. Our apartment is on the 20th floor of our building and faces the southwest. It has floor to ceiling windows and gets a lot of sun in the afternoon, so I fully expected the temperature to rise. When I started, I did not know what affect the temperature of the room would have on the experiment. Generally, as the experiment proceeded it became clear that the hotter the room was the better. In a hotter environment, around 85°, the wax was more open to manipulation yet still able to maintain some rigidity, and when I applied a bit more heat, with just the body heat of my hands, I could make bonds between the wax that did not require using the candle. The temperature of the work environment is dictated by the materials and not the personal comfort of the artisan. This notion of personal suffering or placing the needs of the materials first is echoed in Biringuccio's //Pirotechnia// as well, "He must suffer the great natural heats of summer as well as those excessive and continuous ones from the enormous fires that are used in this art, and likewise in winter suffer the moisture and great coldness of disagreeable water and unendurable cold" (213-214).
* Materials:
** Beeswax: [need details on this from bag and Ass. Profs. how chosen and why]
* Equipment: (it is generally difficult to locate tools for carving that are not modern stainless steel or aluminum. More research is required to assess whether or not tools made of EM (Early Modern) metals behaved differently enough to have an effect on authenticity.)
** Exacto knife: a stainless steel tipped carving knife; no anticipated negative effect on authenticity.
** Multi-tip stylus: aluminum handled, stainless steel tipped stylus with multiple interchangeable heads; no anticipated negative effect on authenticity.
** Painting knife: crome plated painting knife with plastic handle; no anticipated negative effect on authenticity.
** Compass: aluminum multi-tip compass; I had some initial hesitation about using this tool. I used it for maintaining dimensions and making circles in the wax. It was incredibly useful when implementing ideas and designs. The fundamental technology of the compass was certainly available in the 16th and 17th century, so even though this was a modern compass, its accuracy could most certainly be replicated in the EME.
** Candle: white wax 8-hour emergency candle; probably one of the most important tools that I had. In apply heat, the properties of the candle were various and nuanced. Parts of the candle gave off more heat than others. The tip had the greatest heat but left black carbon on the tools. The base would allow for slow heating, allowing you to regulate how much heat you applied, and keep your tool free from carbon. During the positive method, how the wax was held to the candle mattered a great deal, as will be explored below.
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Small frying pan: Used to melt used wax. The pan had a teflon coating, however when I used it to reconstitute the wax and make thin strips to be used in the </span>positive<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> method, the method I used to extract the wax from the pan after it had cooled would have negated the benefit of the non-stick coating, thus the effect on authenticity would have been mitigated. </span>
** Natural Gas Stove: no anticipated negative effect on authenticity.
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:IMG_1626.JPG width="351"]][[image:IMG_1628.jpg width="202" height="267"]]</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Discussion on Procedure:</span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">My primary intention with this experiment was to explore the differences between the negative and positive methods of wax mold construction. By negative, I mean starting with a large block of wax and forming the end product by removing the excess material </span>around<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> it (AKA in relief). By positive, I mean starting with a base of wax and building the object by adding </span>pieces<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> of wax to build the form.</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Serial #1: Coin - constructed using the negative method</span>
** I started with a solid block of wax approx. ¾ of an inch thick, which was formed in a muffin tray. I wanted to make some sort of coin by cutting into the face. I started by finding the centre of the block and using the compass to mark out the edges. I then used the compass to mark out the edge of the coin and the boundaries of the lettering.
** I then used the exact knife to remove the excess around the lettering and image on the front (Yes, I put Bread Molders, a piece of bread, and Craft and Science For Life on the coin. I couldn't think of anything else. Hopefully, we are marked on method not content).
[[image:IMG_1631.jpg width="190" height="250" align="center"]]
** Carving away the excess in the coin proved to be a difficult task. Heating the tools with the candle helped in smoothing out the background. Keeping the tools and wax warm help a lot with manipulation. Heating the tools should be done with the bottom of the flame as the top will leave blacking and make it very hard to see what is happening.
** It was hard to judge the depth of the relief, especially with the beeswax. Parts of the beeswax can be slightly translucent and better vision than mine is required to distinguish the depth. Better lighting and magnification would aid in this. Another colour of wax may also help as well, this may be part of the reason that red was often used.
* Serial #2: Commemorative Medal - constructed using the positive method
** For the second iteration I wanted to do a one sided commemoration medal. I decided to do my family crest (or at least what the internet tells me is my family crest).
** I found that the thickness of the coin presented a problem when judging depth and it will also take a lot of metal to cast, so I decided to flatten out the other disc by heating it and remoulding it into a thiner disc. To get the discs themselves, I simply melted the wax in the frying pan and let it cool. Once cool the wax would not come out of the pan. To get the wax out of the pan, I turned the stove on high and moved the pan in and out of the heat until the wax, while pressing on with my hand, started to spin. Once it was spinning, I removed it very quickly with the painting knife. The result was a thin piece of wax that I could make the backing and cut outs.
** I used the compass to mark a much larger circle than the coin.
** I took all of my other used wax and melted it into an even larger and thinner disc, removing it from the pan in the same manner. I then constructed the crest piece by piece by cutting parts from the thinner disc.
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:IMG_1632.jpg width="144" height="187"]][[image:IMG_1634.JPG width="243" height="184"]]</span>
** Affixing the parts to the backing was tricky at first. I didn't know how to apply them at first. I attempted to use the candle to heat the back of some of the pieces and then placing them on the backing. It became evident very fast that this was going to require some technique. The following is a description of my successes and failures with heating wax with the flame.
*** I attempted to slowly heat a piece by holding it as a distance from the flame. This was not successful because the piece of wax became to malleable and folded in on itself;
*** I decided to hold the wax above the flame to see if I could melt the outside faster and still maintain the structure of the piece. This worked better, however it made the piece black (note: this could actually be an advantage it one wanted to distinguish the piece from others, in the end blacking doesn't really matter as the end product will be metal not wax); and
*** The best method turned out to be holding the piece to the bottom of the flame very close and removing it quickly. By 'flashing' the piece tot he flame this way, you could get a piece that was free of blacking, melted but still strong enough to maintain its shape.
<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:IMG_1635.jpg width="198" height="261"]][[image:IMG_1636.jpg width="195" height="255"]][[image:IMG_1637.JPG width="339" height="257"]]</span>
** Thankfully, the temperature in the room had increased making easier to affix the pieces. I was even able to affix a few pieces by just applying pressure and heat with my hands.
<span style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">**General Observations and Questions**</span>
** Adding material to the form was far easier and more enjoyable than working in relief. The negative method was frustrating and it was not always clear how deep the knife was or when the desired depth have been reached. More practice would almost certainly make my performance with the negative process better, however I am struggling to see just what advantages working in relief would provide over the positive. In contrast, the additive process was clean, easily organized and provided a better looking result.
** After the class had visited the MET and we had seen the example medals from the 16th and 17th centuries, I decided to make several improvements to the model that I have already constructed. Firstly, they need to be more conical. There is too much depth on the coin and the medallion has some overhang that could actually make the model fail. Secondly, the MET examples were incredibly detailed. I really want to see if I can achieve this level of detail. Some new carving tools that I have obtained should help.
** __The economics and social structure of work in the workshop and where we could be going wrong in the lab__: During the last few experiments, especially in the lab, I have been thinking a lot about economics and the structure of the work in the workshop. Many economic principles are evident in the experiments we are conducting: division of labor is the most evident. Breaking down a large project into smaller tasks is such a natural tendency in the experiments were are conducting. Even in the small scale experiments directing the activities of labor is ever-present. Splitting up labor seems to lead to a natural split between those who preform the work and those who are directing it. The nature of the materials we are working also seem to have an effect on this structure. Pouring, heating, and design choices are better left to one person's discretion. Without doing so the objects we create can become monstrosities created by a committee. If we are going to approach the nature of the materials and how the artisans interacted with these materials, then we should bear in mind that their social structure and division of labor was a large part of that. In conducting these experiments should not we take care to design our workflows in a similar manner to our subjects. Assigning roles and nominating decision makers within the experiment would aid in mimicking the organization and workflow in the EM workshop.
** I also cannot shake the implications of our artisan being motivated by profit first. Much of the language he uses indicates that he is concerned about minimizing costs while increasing effect. I would like to explore more about how cost and profit are evidenced and relevant in the manuscript. I do not believe that it is unfair to say that he is a salesman first and artist second.
** Every step of the process resulted in some kind of damage to the end product. Over the entire process the damage to the end product became cumulative and exponential. Not paying attention to even the minutest detail in one stage can lead to a large defect in a later stage. The phenomenon of generation loss (i.e. the loss of quality as a result of making a copy of a copy of a copy) is ever-present. This experience illustrates exactly the points made by Biringuccio in //Pirotechnia//, "Therefore you must plan to spare no labor or expense and to be careful and very patient in every detail in order to bring all the means which you are to use to perfection. Remember that often the whole depends on some small thing; for example, a poorly made binding or ill-fitted joint, the leaking of the mould through a crack, or a little earth of charcoal or something else which falls in the moulds or plugs the entrance of the gate falls across it when it is being filled up, the snapping of a wire of the binding, or in the floating up of a brick" (Biringuccio, 216).
** After visiting Ubaldo's Workshop and seeing how many thousands of tools he had accumulated over his long career, I found myself thinking about the nature of tools, their creation and their evolution. In a physical (and abstract) way his shop is directly connected to the history of man's quest to manipulate the natural world, via tools and machines. Every tool that Ubaldo possesses was constructed at some point by other tools that existed in the past, and those tools were in turn constructed by older tools, and so on. Following this chain of creation backwards, while simultaneously projecting it forward into the technology of our contemporary world, it can be argued that even a piece of modern technological wizardry (i.e. a laser cutting system, 3D printer, even your cell phone) is, in a very real way, physically connected to the most rudimentary stone tools of our ancient history. It stands to reason then that tools, like the humans who generate and utilize them, have a genetic blueprint that can be traced backwards in time.

<span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">DATE AND TIME: 171600 Sep 14</span>
<span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">LOCATION: Brooklyn, NY - Apartment on 20th floor</span>
<span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">SUBJECT: p0029r - Stucco for Molding Reconstruction (SMR)</span>
* <span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">VIDEO COMING SOON.</span>
* <span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">Before we attempted our second iteration of the BMR we had intended to use tragacanth gum in one of the mixtures. Upon closer inspection of the recipe it became clear that the 'stucco' was intended as a sculpting agent and not for casting. Obviously this did not fit into the BMR experiment. For the sake of curiosity, and partially because I had already bought the tragacanth gum (which was rather expensive), I decided to attempt the recipe on my own.</span>
* Equipment:
** <span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">Stucco knife - tragacanth gum when in a jelly form is extremely difficult to work with. In order to manipulate the material it was necessary to grab a modern stucco knife. As is described later in these field notes the tragacanth gum presented a high level of agency (See. Ingold ch. 18 and Lehmann). </span>
** <span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 19px;">Granite Counter Top - It was necessary to use a modern polished marble counter top. The experiment started with a wooden cutting board, however it was necessary switch as the adhesion of the tragacanth gum was too much.</span>
** Ceramic Mixing bowl - No anticipated affect on authenticity.
** Stainless Steel Mixing bowl X2 - No anticipated affect on authenticity.
** Plastic measuring spoons - <span style="line-height: 1.5;">No anticipated affect on authenticity. </span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Silicon Mixing Spatula - No anticipated affect on authenticity.</span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Crome Mixing Knife - used in painting. No anticipated affect on authenticity. </span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ingredients:</span>
** Tragacanth gum - the only tragacanth gum that I was able to obtain was in a finely powdered form. The recipe called for the tragacanth gum to be "dip[ed] into; to drinks all the water and is swollen and turned into jelly". This may indicate that it could be in a purely solid form, as 'dipping' implies a solid object.
** Rye flour - Rye flour was selected as the recipe states that it is better than wheat.
** Linseed Oil - The recipe calls for cane oil, AKA calamus oil derived from the //Acorus calamus// root, however cane oil is toxic and is banned in the US (See http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=189.110). I decided to substitute linseed oil, due to its drying properties when used in painting and my past experience with it. I did not add any turpentine as I would usually do while using it as a painting medium.
* Serial #1:
** The recipe states "Have some tragacanth gum and let it dip until it drinks all the water and is swollen and turned into jelly. Then grind it strongly on marble..." (p029r). I am taking this to mean that the gum is in a solid state as opposed to the highly refined and powdered form than I have. Since we are instructed to 'grind [the jelly]', I may achieve the desired result if I produce a malleable homogeneous substance.
** I commenced filming and combined tragacanth gum in a plastic mixing bowl with water. I placed 1 Tsp of tragacanth gum in a bowl and added about a table spoon of water. This immediately disappeared into the powder forming hard blobs that later resisted dissolving. I added more water in attempt to break up the clumps and this was my first learning experience. The tragacanth gum reacts very strongly with water; it absorbs the liquid very quickly and even a slight dusting of the gum in powdered form sticks to any moisture and forms a rather disproportionately larger slick oily layer that is very difficult to wash off. Once it absorbs a small amount of water it can harden very fast and prevent further dissolving even when immersed in water. I continued to add water, one Tsp at a time, until a "jelly" (as p029r calls for) starts to form. In order to achieve the desired consistency I have to remove it from the mixing vessel and start to grind it on the marble counter top with a stainless steel stucco knife. While this might have affected the authenticity of the experiment, it was necessary. The gum is just to difficult to manipulate with porous materials like wood and hands. Smooth materials are required.
** After 20 mins of mixing I added linseed oil with a brush as stated in the recipe. With the addition of the oil the mixture became much more manageable. I was concerned at first because the material seemed to separate uncontrollably, however after applying more pressure and mixing for another 10 mins the cohesion was regained. Because of the oil the material was much more manageable with bare hands and could be manipulated into three dimensional objects as the recipe suggests.
** After arriving as the end of the preparation phase, I had to decide what to sculpt. If occurred to me that this is a step that should have been performed before the experiment started. The object that I would have intended to sculpt would have had placed demands on the material I was mixing to build said object. The final material could be molded into a two dimensional figures placed on a flat surface. I ended up crafting an antler (or a branch, I really am not a sculptor) (on left in picture below).
* Serial #2:
** In the second serial my goal was to increase the strength of the material and the detail it could handle. I also wanted to create a large batch in order to see if I could sculpt a larger object.
** To start this iteration, tried to mix the tragacanth gum in a way that it would not clump and be difficult to work with. I tried to drop the gum into water a bit by bit, but it would not dissolve. I ended up mixing it in the water and experiencing the same problems as before. I ended up mixing 1 ¼ cup of water with 3 Tsp of tragacanth gum.
** Adding the flour little by little to the tragacanth gum proved a difficult way to judge the appropriate amount with such a large amount. In total, I added 1 Cup of rye flour.
** When it came time to add the linseed oil it was difficult to judge how much should be added. The recipe says to "rub it with some cane oil with a brush so the oil soak into it to make it more detachable" (p029r). Since I was working with a much larger amount as the last time I added more oil to the mixture. However, I did not experience the same separation of the material as I did the last time. Even with the addition of the oil the mixture remained very sticky. The mixture became more viscous and remained sticky and difficult to work with the more oil I added. I eventually go to a point where I felt that I have had too much oil and the added some additional flour to counter act the wetness of the mixture.
** In the end the mixture came out very different from the first iteration. This mixture was much harder to work with even with the addition of the linseed oil, it stuck to hands and even the . It was much weaker and was not as easily manipulated as before.
** I decided to try sculpting it into a "bed ornament" as the recipe calls for. I was (sort of) able to craft something that looked like an ornament (pictured on bottom in picture). This was more due to my sculpting skill, not the material.
** Within a day both results were dry. The models had become extremely hard and sturdy. The 'stucco' proved to be an amazingly strong material.
** After a few days some cracks in the second model appeared. The material may not have a long-term purpose.

* Observations:
** Over coming the material: Tragacanth gum is an amazing material. When added with water it comes to life and has a mind of its own. As much as I wanted to manipulate it, it stuck to what it wanted to, formed the shapes in parameter that were determined by it. The manipulation was like a negotiation rather than fitting any vision I could come up for it.

* Second Experiment:
** Based on feedback from class we are going to attempt the experiment with leavening agent.
** The apartment was a constant 72 degrees <span style="line-height: 1.5;">fahrenheit throughout the experiment.</span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ingredients:</span>
*** Flour - This time we are varying the types of flour; we are utilizing a finely stone ground wheat flour (purchased at Eataly), an whole grain ground flour (also purchased at Eataly), and rye flour (purchased at Brooklyn Fare).
*** Water - tap water at room temperature.
*** Salt - ground sea salt from the Mediterranean coast in Cyprus was used.
*** Sourdough starter - Courtesy of Dr. Smith; the culture was feed once to obtain enough to preform the experiment.
*** Equipment:
**** Mixing bowls: plastic - should not affect authenticity to a drastic amount;
**** Mixing utensils: stainless steel fork - no anticipated material effect;
**** Cutting board: large wooden - no anticipated material effect;
**** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Large serrated bread knife - this was located shortly after the first </span>experiment, should provide a more authentic result<span style="line-height: 1.5;">; and</span>
**** Natural Gas Oven: Will eliminate randomness or inconsistencies that may have been present in EM ovens, however due to living conditions it is not possible to eliminate its use.
** Iteration 2.1, 2.2, 2.3:
*** For this experiment we utilized an amalgamation of several modern sourdough recipes. EM bread recipes were very difficult to locate and the dearth of them is puzzling. Since cooking and kitchen life was more inserted into the lives of EM peoples then it stands to reason that bread and its construction was simply understood. Indeed EM peoples likely possessed a greater range of daily hands-on knowledge than we would have: horse riding, fire making, seam-stressing (sp?), and other activities involving EM kitchen technologies . As well, more complex system of various uses and origins have been passed on verbally for ages. Sourdough may simply be among the most basic vocabulary of the kitchen and therefore no many authors saw a need to reproduce its construction on paper and disseminate it;
*** For this experiment the only variable that we varied was the type of dough. We utilized three flours: a stone ground finely sifted wheat pastry flour; a whole grain wheat flour; and a rye flour (pictured below);

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">[[image:20140917_170404.jpg width="311" height="184"]][[image:20140917_170347.jpg width="311" height="183"]][[image:20140917_170338.jpg width="316" height="185"]]</span>
*** all doughs were mixed in the following proportions:
**** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">1 cup flour;</span>
**** ⅓ cup starter;
**** ⅓ cup water; and
**** ⅔ tsp salt.
*** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">all doughs were rolled into two individual balls and place in plates and covered with a clean dish towel;</span>
*** There was no noticeable difference in the sizes of the doughs while they were rising. This led us to think that we have failed in mixing the proper amounts. Alas we did not give up and marched on with the baking; and
*** all doughs were cooked at 425° for 20 mins. Due to the time involved in mixing and rising, the doughs were placed in the oven in staggered 10 min intervals until all required cooking was complete.
** Observations:
*** The rye flour took the impression the best, although none of the results rivaled the results of the first experiment (i.e. simply dough and water);
*** The starter appears to have introduced cavities and defects into the impressions that may affect the final casting. Cracking and breaking were also more prevalent during the pressing stage. However, we will not know for sure until the doughs are cast.

* We presented the results of our first iteration to the class. The discussion was helpful and cleared up several issues surrounding nomenclature and our understanding about what the artisan were attempting to create. It was noted that the started or yeast may provide us with the ability to retain information better or hold the result together better. If the interaction between our original Medieval Play-dough and the sulphur that is to be cast does not go as planned (i.e. breaks or provides a bad mold), then we will have isolated the yeast as the potential agent that makes the bread interact differently with the sulphur. We will only know this when we actually pour the molds, next tuesday.

* First Experiment:
** Based on research done the day prior we decided to attempt the recipe using just finely ground flour and water. We decided to preform there iterations, varying the mixture and procedure based on the results of the first.
** The apartment was a constant 72 degrees fahrenheit throughout the experiment.
** Ingredients:
*** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Finely ground stone wheat flour - we used a wheat four that was very finely ground and well sifted; purchased at Eataly; we choose this flour because it was the homogenous as possible and had the consistency that many other recipes in the French Manuscript demanded; utilized at room temperature. </span>
*** Water - tap water at room temperature.
** Equipment:
*** Mixing bowls: plastic - should not affect authenticity to a drastic amount;
*** Mixing utensils: bamboo spoon - similar consistency to larger wooden spoon, no anticipated material effect; stainless steel fork - no anticipated material effect;
*** Cutting board: large wooden - no anticipate material effect;
*** Small serrated cutting knife: utilized on the first iteration of the Experiment, no anticipated material effect;
*** Ceramic cutting knife: for the second and third iterations of the first experiment we utilized a ceramic knife. This was due to myself forgetting that I had a perfectly good bread knife in the drawer. It is hoped that the pressing of the objects in the dough would have eliminated any variation in surface smoothness, thus a ceramic knife would not have affected the result to greatly; and
*** Natural Gas Oven: Will eliminate randomness or inconsistencies that may have been present in EM ovens, however due to living conditions it is not possible to eliminate its use.

<span style="display: block; text-align: center;">
</span>
** <span style="display: block; line-height: 1.5; text-align: center;">Recipe</span>
*** We decided to work with the recipe 'Molding and reducing a big piece' from page 140v in the manuscript as our base line recipe. We reinterpreted the term 'bread' to mean a plaster-like materials made out of dough and water, straight out of the oven; essentially, Medieval Play-dough, heated. Our reasons for preforming such a step are outlined in the 14 Sep 14 entry.
** Iteration 1.1:
*** We combined 1 cup of flour and ½ cup of water in a mixing bowl and stirred;
*** our goal was to mix the dough and water until "it can be stretched without breaking, and if it is not strong enough it can’t be well detached" (p029r). The dough needed to be stringy but not so much so that cannot maintain its shape;
*** The final mixture ended up being 1 ¼ cups of flour and 1 cup of water;
*** we placed the mix in a ball and placed it in a cooking pan greased with butter and placed it in the oven at 350° for 20 mins;
*** the decision to remove the bread was made based upon its appearance in the oven;
*** We removed the bread and immediately cut it horizontally into halves and pressed in for objects to be cast (A military cap badge, a locket, a commemorative coin and a small carabiner);
*** Emily pressed all the objects, so as to maintain consistency. I myself pressed on objects in order to observe the depth and firmness, for my own curiosity; and
*** After approx. 2 mins we removed the objects and placed the molds to the side ready for casting.
** Iteration 2.1:
*** for this iteration we followed more or less the same procedure. Our deviations came when mixing, cooking and cutting;
*** the viscosity of the mixture was increased and the composition of the dough ended up being 1 ¼ cups of dough and 1 cup of water;
*** we mixed the ingredients with vigor with a stainless steel fork. This increased the homogeneity of the mixture IMO.
*** due to the high viscosity of the dough/batter we placed it in a cupcake sheet, charging four chambers;
*** due to the dough's increased surface area, we decreased the cooking time. The dough cooked for a total of 15 mins.;
*** during cutting the small serrated knife we were utilizing proved inadequate. In our urgency we grabbed a ceramic knife to finish the experiment. This may have affected our authenticity, however I believe that the impact was negligible as the pressure of pressing would have equalized the area under the object and it is possible that there may have been knives of comparable sharpness; and
*** these mold were noticeable better in quality than the first. This is most likely due to the vicious nature of the mixture and the homogeneity achieved in the mixing process.
** Iteration 1.3
*** For this iteration we went back to our original mixture: 1 ¼ cups of flour and 1 cup of water;
*** we cooked the dough for 20 mins and cut it in half with the ceramic knife;
*** we pressed the objects and returned the pressed sought to the oven for an additional 10 mins of cooking at 350°. IAW 140v we wanted to establish the shrinking properties of the dough;
*** we removed the molds and let them cool for 10 mins and placed them back in the oven for an additional 10 mins;
*** once again we removed the molds and measured their change in dimensions and by trying to attempt reinsert the original objects. On average the molds had shrunk approx.
**** <span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> Badge: 2 ¼ inches (original) to 2 ⅛ inches (new) - 6% decrease;</span>
**** <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Carabiner: 2 inches to 1 ⅞ inches - 6% decrease; </span>
**** <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Locket: 1 ¼ inches to 1 1/16 inches - 15% decrease; and</span>
**** <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Coin: 1 13/16th inches to 1 9/16 inches - 13 % decrease.</span>
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Observations:</span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Splitting was a large issue with the molds. Several pieces did not maintain their integrity under pressure and split along the sides. </span>
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">I still question our </span>initial<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> decision to press the objects </span>while<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> still in the crust of the bread, however since some recipes do mention a 'box' used during molding (p081v, p082r, p089r, p118v-119r, 145r, p161r) this may have provided additional structural </span>integrity to make the molds successful.

* Secured doughs for mixing bread (see pic below). <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Will put together a sourdough tonight. I hope there is enough time for it to collect yeast.</span>
* Finding rye dough is difficult in NYC. I went to three stores to find some and no luck. Had to order from a specially store, however my experience with them tells me that they (Brooklyn Fare - a local grocery chain in Brooklyn) are unreliable. Scheduled for delivery tomorrow.
* Sourdough Starter Mixing:
** <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Had an exceptionally hard time finding a EM sourdough recipe. Ultimately decided to use a modern recipe that called for no commercial yeast to be added. (http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-your-own-sourdough-starter-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-47337)</span>
** NOTE: I have some reservations about using a bread that has been prepared with a starter or a yeast. Wouldn't they be to porous to capture the information on the object? Could bread in this instance simply be understood to not contain yeast or starter? Is the word bread use for the lack of a more developed term, something that would indicate the 'bread' is a object of manufacturing and not Need to find confirmation of this. UPDATE: The stucco recipe on page 29r gives instructions for molding with wheat and tragacanth gum. The recipe on 29r and 140v are both intended to be used for molding. If their intended use is the same, then shouldn't their properties be the same? If, and this needs to be confirmed, tragacanth does not rise when cooked, then it is possible that this property should extend to other recipes as well. Words like fine, smooth are used often, and steps are taken to specifically avoid bubbles, in the medium and the mold material, "<span style="line-height: 1.5;">After preparing your hollow mold of sulfur or another [material] and oiling it and surrounding it with a circle, soak your plaster in water, not too thick, and rub it well with your finger, and if it makes bubbles, throw on more powder of the said plaster and crush it with your finger until it makes no more bubbles" (p012r). I am against adding yeast or sourdough starter at this point. </span>**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Based on this we are going to </span>attempt the experiment without leavening agent<span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span>**
*** "Have some tragacanth gum and let it dip until it drinks all the water and is swollen and turned into jelly. Then grind it strongly on marble and then have some rye flour which is better than the wheat one for it is more humid and don’t make the batter so dry and spread your tragacanth gum and keep grinding and mingle little by little the very finely sieved flour and knead it as if you wanted to make some bread until you reckon that is thick enough and firm like bread pastry you want to put in the oven" (p029r).
* p115v in the FM offers some good guidance about how to avoid breaking mold due to heat. I think we should incorporate this step into our exercise.
* We should examine other recipes in the French Manuscript and other sources to answer the following questions:
** How much pressure should be applied to the mold on the object and for how long?
** How hot or cold, relative to room temperature, should the objects to be molded be?
** What agents are required to ensure that the mold does not catastrophically adhere to the object?
** Is there a technique for applying the pith? Top-Bottom, Left-right? How does the caster avoid trapping air between the cast and the mold.

* In order to avoid confusion or risk 'reflexivity', we are going to take steps to lay out, as much as possible, how the experiment is going to be conducted.
* Laying out the Experiment (this entry is subject to change as more research is done):
** Objective: To preform the recipe contained on page 140v of BnF Ms. 640 in order to recreate the process and examine the results.
** Parameters: Time - To be completed NLT
** Iterations: The experiment will be preformed 9 times with three different doughs on three different objects of varying degrees of detail in order to measure the impact of the results.
** Ingredients: Water, flour leavening agent.
** Equipment: Wood cutting board, metal tin for bread. Mixing instruments.
** Procedure:
*** Pre-experimental steps
**** Much of the information gathering and notes on ingredients on equipment can be done before hand, with the exception of what the experiment reveals. Doing so with save us time and effort when it come to actually preforming the experiment.
*** Planning the experiment
*** 
** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">AAR (After Action Review)</span>
*** <span style="line-height: 1.5;">This should be a step that we preform formally, after we have conducted each </span>step of the experiment.
* We will use the recipe on page 140v of the French Manuscript as the baseline recipe for our experiment. It is as follows:
** "Molding and reducing a big piece - Mold it with the pith of the bread just out of the oven, or like that aforementioned, & and in drying out it will diminish & by consequence so too the medal that you have cast. You can, in this way, in lengthening out or enlarging the imprinted bread, vary the figure & from one face make several quite different ones. The bread straight from the oven is best. And that which has been reheated twice shrinks more. You can cast sulfur without letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But, if you want to let it diminish, let it dry either more or less" (140v).
* <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Other recipes will be used to determine what kind of consistency and properties we are looking for in the materials manipulated during the experiment and to fill in tacit assumptions that the main recipe. Those sources are as follows: </span>

===<span style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">**General Observations and Questions**</span>=== 
* In preparation for this experiment, I was completing refresher training on the some video editing software that we intend to use. I noted that learning the process was similar to the hands-on experimentation that we are examining. To use this program one must utilize a series of key strokes to manipulate video clips and editing tools. It occurred to me that this process of learning keystrokes to preform an action is not unlike learning the uses of materials and techniques we are studying. In order to be efficient and produce a quality product, one must assimilate the keystrokes as a type of language. If I tried to create something from scratch without familiarizing myself to techniques before hand, then my progress would be slowed to the point where fleeting moments of ingenuity and insight would be lost. Speed is required and moments of irrational decision making are required. Not unlike the acquisition of language, one does not carry around a dictionary, a verb conjugation manual to order to speak. It appears that the subconscious mind is responsible for much in the process of making, possibly even more so than the consciousness mind.
* The views of the camera are going to be inferior to our own personal experiences. While a camera allows us to record a point of view when the experiment is conducted, it does lack many of the human senses that are important to the process. The camera cannot feel heat, pressure (through physical contact or via the air), viscosity, texture. It cannot smell evidence of burning, humidity, sweetness or rot. It also lacks perception of a third dimension and the ability to move in conjunction with curiosity and reflex. Every effort must be made to record our observations through writing, with particular focus to what the camera may have missed.
* <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Before the experiment ofMeasurements as adjectives and descriptors. Might be the only way to achieve a universal pre-21st century system of weights and measures. What is universal? Religious thought, literature, language (that complicates things). </span>
* <span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Almost every ingredient that we have come across during our experiments and research possess a cultural or religious significance. Before we performed the second iteration of the BMR, I was researching how to source 'cane oil' in the 'Stucco for Molding' recipe on 29r in BnF Ms 640. Cane oil is also known as Calamus Oil and comes from the //Acorus calamus// plant and is currently banned in the US due to toxicity (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=189.110). </span>You can still find online retailers, but the cost is prohibitive, and we are not interested in messing around with ingredients that are labeled toxic. Cane root was used although at the time of writing these claims have not been corroborated with other evidence. It is amazing how something that serves as an smaller ingredient of a much larger object can have a large history and significance in itself. The physical act of combination says much about the motives and world-view of the assembler.</span>
* <span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Longsword fighting reconstruction article: </span>http://www.nytimes.com/video/sports/100000003040466/inside-the-world-of-longsword-fighting.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=1409232722000&bicmet=1419773522000&_r=0
* In spite of the difficulties of working with the materials, the author of the French Manuscript never really addresses what tools he is using. Tragacanth gum is extremely difficult to work with; it is extremely sticky when wet and makes an awful mess. Dealing with the difficulties of the materials is rarely mentioned. The materials seem to dictate the focus of the recipe, not the human interactions with the materials. This is probably due to his level of experience with manipulating the materials; an amateur like myself would no doubt waste a lot of time developing the core skills needed to manipulate the materials rather than focusing on the materials themselves. The shortcomings of my skills are the primary focus of my interactions, where as the materials are the focus of his. Is this the difference between master and apprentice?
* Recipes seem to start and end at transfer points or stages in the process of creation where the different inputs can be manipulated. There seems to be continuous cycle of input-material refinement-output-process refinement-input this is not unlike current manufacturing or project workflows. The study of operations management may be able to provide more insight.

===Notes directly related to the experiment=== 
* Make note of how you are trying to remain as authentic as possible and what was lost where you were forced to cut corners
* Verb usage, origin of words
* significance of ingredients, religious or otherwise
* Selection of ingredients is paramount
* Explain the potential traps that could lessen authenticity and explain how they were mitigated as much as possible; similar to composite risk management?
* Adding ingredients incrementally until the appropriate result is obtained may be the best approach to a lot of problems (i.e. heat, water, seasoning, etc...)
* Address how you compensated for measurement and timing discrepancies
* What assumptions is the author making about its audience? The actual recipe is not even complete. It requires prior knowledge on how to prepare a tart for consumption.
* What tacit knowledge exists in the recipe?: How to make a tart. How to apply heat to the object. How to combine ingredients (which is interesting because so many other ingredients use a variety of verbs to describe this step)?
* Made an assumptions about the level of sophistication of EME cookery and kitchens that were quickly cleared up by viewing Scappi's culinary treatise Opera (1570):
** did not think that they used metal - used metal in a very sophisticated manner
** did not think that they refined their spices into powders due to a lack of technology - they did so with precision
** Many of the instruments they used were exactly as we possessed. Our 'level of sophistication' was now the only question.
* Debate over which ginger to use. The fresh ginger seemed out of place considering the other spices. Since ginger was not indigenous to England it was certainly imported, but in what form, raw or powder. Subsequent research revealed that Ginger originated in South East Asia and was transported as a living rhizome to Europe and to other regions to be cultivated in the EME (Natural History Museum, Seeds of Trade, Online resource, http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/life/plants-fungi/seeds-of-trade/page.dsml?section=regions®ion_ID=6&page=spread&ref=spices [accessed 8 Sep 14]). The OED states that ginger is "The rhizome of the tropical plant Zingiber officinale, remarkable for its hot spicy taste; used when dried and ground in cookery and as a medicine; also preserved in syrup or candied as a sweetmeat" (OED, http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/view/Entry/78372?rskey=XuayJD&result=1&isAdvanced=false#eid). Based on the OED entry we felt safe in using ground ginger.
* Forming the paste was a significant obstacle. The recipe mentions nothing about this process. We had to infer from other contemporary recipes
* What dish or base for cooking do we need to use? Porcelain or glass dish as is common today? We used a metal pot as was pictured in Scappi's Opera (1570)
* The primary recipe specifies no measurements, however the secondary recipe for the dough does
** "a quart of the finest flower”
*** A quart was taken to be equivalent to one modern quart of the English system for measuring volume. More research could have been done into the evolution and variations with respect to measurements in the EME, unfortunately time constraints did not allow this. Every effort there after was taken to ensure that proportions were maintained with the quart measurement in mind.
** “a little cold water”
*** the exact amount was impossible to discern from this description, so we decided that when it came time to add the water we would do so a minute amount at time and keep doing so until we gained the desired effect. EME cooks must of created their own system to deal with the ambiguity of recipes. Did a need for standardization arise out of this? Could a multiplicity of cook all working from the same book have given rise to the need for standardized measurements?
** “small peeces of butter as big as Nuts”.
*** at first we struggled to decide on which kind of nut we were expected to model (walnuts, almonds, etc...). We eventually decided on a hazelnut, as this falls into a middle range of nut sizes, in our opinion.

* Assay #1 & 2 concurrently
** The dough was created first
*** a quart of flour, two egg yolks and one egg white were added to a bowl and mixed;
*** small amounts of cold water (tap cold) were added to the bowl until the paste obtained the desired consistency as judged by us (we felt that the paste need only be malleable enough for the addition of the butter;
*** the paste was removed from the bowl and placed on a counter top that had been sprinkled with flour. Neither recipe makes any mention of flouring the counter top or the rolling pin, however this was done any attempt to mild the dough with the rolling pin would have created a condition where the dough became uncontrollable;
*** per the instructions, butter was added to the dough and it was refolded over ten times;
*** found that the temperature of the butter mattered when rolling. If the butter was too cold then the butter would not work into the dough; too hot and it became unmanageable and tore the dough during rolling. After a few tears we cooled the butter in the freezer and continued with the process. (In retrospect, freezing the butter should not have been done. We should have tried to find a solution outside of a modern instrument. It would have been better if we simply worked with the butter at the temperature it was. That need to innovate could have given us a better insight into how an early modern cook could have dealt with the problem. Unfortunately, this became a missed opportunity.)
*** In total ¾ of a cup of butter was used to make the dough.
** The jelly was then created
*** the reconstituted rose hips were placed in a mixing bowl;
*** Sugar was added in small increments until the taste was pleasing, in our own judgement. A total of ⅔ of a cup was used;
*** Cinnamon was slowly added until the taste was pleasing. A total of 3 tsp. were used;
*** Ginger was slowly added until the taste was pleasing. A total of 3 tsp. were used;
**** Emily was responsible at first for adding the cinnamon and ginger. She kept doing to until she stated 'I can't tell if I have put enough in'. At a certain point her ability to smell and taste became overwhelmed and she could no longer tell if her incremental additions. To rectify this she asked me to take over the addition of these seasons.
*** Nutmeg was then added, WAIT A MINUTE, STOP!!!!!
**** No where in the recipe does it say anything about nutmeg, yet we both had participated in the preparation, photographing, and grinding of Nutmeg in preparation for the jelly. This oversight made it all the way through our process, to the bowl and in. Luckily, we caught it in time to remove the nutmeg from the bowl without losing any material amount of the jelly. The incident has been officially dubbed "the Nutmeg Debacle of 2014".
** 
** Once the Jelly was prepared, the dough was rolled out thin enough as too provide us with two attempts at making a tart. Due to our prior discussion on whether or not the tart was open faced or closed face we decided to make two tarts: one open-faced and in a pan another closed cooked on a flat surface.
* The tarts were then placed in the oven as a temperature that we thought would be reasonably hot to cook the tarts. The measured temperature turned out to be around 350 degrees. The tarts were checked every five minutes for signs of being cooked and were removed when we judged them to be done. The open-faced tart cooked for 35 mins and the closed face version took 50 mins to cook.
* The tarts are, hopefully, ready to eat.

===Notes indirectly related to the experiment=== 
* Thomas Dawson:
** No information on him in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; genealogical search (familysearch.org) indicates that a Thomas Dawson was born in 1580 in Cottingham, Yorkshire, England and died in 1620. No confirmation if this is the same person, however the death dates match.
** Investigation into Cottingham may bear more fruit on the food culture that existed there, however this is doubtful.
** why would TD write a book directed at 'good wives'? the title page seems to suggest that his intention lie in aiding married couples "Also certain approved point of husbandry, very necessarie for al Husbandmen to know".
** More than likely he saw a market among women and directed his efforts there. This book was reprinted in 1596 and in 1610. He also wrote another part to 'the good housewives' in 1597 and 'A book of cookery' which was published in 1620 and reprinted in 1629 and 1650.
** Was he selling his own intellectual property or cultivating his image? how did this function beyond the book it self? what other methods were used to promote himself? Book tour vis-a-vis Hillary Clinton? or something similar;
** on page 20 of the book is located a recipe called "To make a tart that is a courage to a man or woman", courage meaning aphrodisiac. More evidence that marriage is definitely a concern of his.
* Due to the need to document and photograph the process, one person (Emily) was designated the cook while the other was designated the recorder (Me)
* So what? What did we learn by preforming this reconstruction?
** As good as our intentions may be, the process of experiential learning demands that we follow the recipe to the letter. Even if difficulties arise we must ensure that we find authentic solutions to these problems. When challenges are perceived as mistakes we run the risk of injecting modern technologies or solutions into the reconstruction;
** Honing our attention to detail is essential to executing the recipe successfully. The mysterious addition of nutmeg shows that human memory, action, and planning are completely fallible;
** The process to cook a tart involves many activities both inside and outside the kitchen;

===General Observations and Questions=== 
* Reconstruction is an interpretation; it is impossible to reproduce the experience absolutely, we can only get so close.
* "There is a danger that by concentrating effort on making the end-product convincing, it might be possible -- either deliberately or subconsciously -- to subordinate the process of reconstruction" (Stinjnman in Clarke, 5)
* Consideration must be given to streamlining work flow and dividing up the division of labor; production of ingredients and inputs is extremely labor intensive, one person could not produce the historical 'object' themselves; a series of relationships was required to accomplish this feat (Feat is the correct noun); the cook or artisan become the focal point for so much activity related to labor and capital that he/she can cultivate a lot of social and intellectual power; Is this where professions get their power? Not so much from the action of the individual, but through the network of interconnected political, agricultural, social and economic systems they command.
* the cook is more of an assembler rather than a producer; refinements and production ingredients can go as far as being an international concern (i.e. the importation of spices and staples)
* labor as an input of production could have been a threat or
* Since inputs are not a decided by the assembler (they cannot conceive or their own tastes, like a painter only has a set number of basic colours that he can combine and manipulate), the unique intellectual efforts (i.e. the combination of flavours, processes and presentation) become the sellable property of the individual;
* how is this type of intellectual property protected in the EME with plagiarism being so common?
* if a society developed to the point where they could produce leisure time and allowed consumption to serve more than the daily dietary requirement then the market for food experiences must then be said to been created. Who and how did the cook come to enter this market? What lead a food preparer to attempt to experiment? What role did women play in this? Hunter/gatherer culture? Not an anthropologist, cannot assume for certain who was preparing food in H/G cultures.
