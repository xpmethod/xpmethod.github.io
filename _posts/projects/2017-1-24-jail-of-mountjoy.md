<i>Finnegans Wake</i> is a text marked by music, yet this simple fact has long been obscured by the forbidding layering of Joyce’s 
prose. A book that should be appreciated for its lyrical assonance and rhythms has become a notorious symbol for impenetrability 
and displeasure. Anyone who has heard Joyce read the “Anna Livia Plurabelle” section can appreciate the <i>Wake</i>’s 
integral aural component. Anyone appreciating Joyce’s penchant for bawdy limericks and coarse double-entendre 
(such as naming a book of poetry, <i>Chamber Music</i>, after the “music” of a chamber pot) can understand his link to unconventional music.

Roland McHugh’s <i>Annotations to Finnegans Wake</i> suggests a structural relationship between Joyce's musicality and referentiality through its spatial arrangement, such that each page resembles sheet music. My project, <i>Jail of Mountjoy</i>, takes this sonic understanding one step further by "playing" indicative sections of these annotations <i>as</i> music. This is accomplished by aligning different categories of reference to respective octaves--e.g. "Professional Jargon," "Linguistic [Taxonomic],” "Linguistic [Categorical]," and so on. Then, sections are processed through a synthesizer to allow users to hear both the level of linguistic depth and type of reference indicated, while synchronized visual animations keep one situated in the text.
