Umang is a digital humanities endeavor for poetic dialogue in South Asia. The
platform showcases curated videos of contemporary poetic thought in more than
seven South Asian languages with English translation. Alongside, it features a
moderated forum where users can submit and share their own poetry, as well as
a blog for exploring the connections between literature, history, and society.
Apart from providing a meeting place for poets, writers, artists, translators,
learners and lovers of the poetic word, Umang seeks to use new media to
amplify traditions of poetic reflection and nurture our capacities for
empathetic, cross-cultural connection.

## SecuringUmang

In June 2014, unknown organizations hacked and wiped the servers in an attempt
to repress critical thought and expression in Pakistan. We will brainstorm and
devise a plan to secure Umang Poetry and protect it for online discourse.
