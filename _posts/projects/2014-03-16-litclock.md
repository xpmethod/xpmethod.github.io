This project was inspired by Christian Marclay's *The Clock*[^1]  Each minute,
the LITclock [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/LITclock) will tweet one
minute in time from a novel or narrative non-fiction book. (Occasionally, a
travel guide chimes in.) Each tweet will be a quote from a book, describing
what is happening in that very minute.

For example, the LIT CLOCK started with a quote from [Christopher
Marlowe](http://books.google.com/books/about/Dr_Faustus.html?id=g3Wy89haCCgC),
at precisely 12:00 am on 3/13/14:

> The clock striketh twelve O it strikes, it strikes! Now body, turn to air

and then thirteen hours and nine minutes later, the LIT CLOCK told us that
Miriam Wu from [Stieg Larsson's Millennium
Trilogy](http://books.google.com/books?id=UvK1Slvkz3MC&dq) is being
interviewed:

> "The time is 1:09 pm." She turned off tape recorder.

Our goal was to create, as [Zadie Smith
said](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/apr/28/killing-orson-welles-midnight/?pagination=false)
of Marclay's clock, "thousands of fictional interpretations of time repurposed
to express time precisely..." The effect, she said, was that "you don’t feel
that you are watching a film, you feel you are existing alongside a film." 

We hope that you'll enjoy existing alongside the nearly 1,000 books that we
pulled quotes from. 

### How did you find time stamps in books?

We created "[Human Intelligence
Tasks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome?variant=worker)" (HITs) on Amazon's
[Mechanical Turks](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/) website. For every minute of
the day, we created one HIT, the task being to search [Google
Books](http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search) for that minute in books. 

This is the layout design we used to create the HITs:
[create-turk-hit.txt](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/mturk/create-turk-hit.txt).
This is the input that created HITs:
[input-time-turk-hit.csv](https://github.com/xpmethod/litclock/tree/master/mturk).
You can find the output of our HIT batches
[here](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/tree/master/mturk).

### How did you get the quotes to Tweet every minute?

Every 60 seconds, [this program](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/cron-bot.py) does the following things:

* First it reads [this file](https://github.com/dhcolumbia/litclock/blob/master/tweets.csv), which has organized tweets and timestamps into 1,440 lines, one for each minute.

* Then it separates each line into two columns, one column for the time, the other for the tweet.

* Then it checks the time on our server's clock. 

* If the current minute matches a timestamp found in the "time" column of tweets.csv, it connects to the Twitter API with our credentials and tweets out the corresponding message.
