*Finnegans Wake* is a text marked by music, yet this simple fact has long been
obscured by the forbidding layering of Joyce’s prose. A book that should be
appreciated for its lyrical assonance and rhythms has become a notorious
symbol for impenetrability and displeasure. Anyone who has heard Joyce read
the “Anna Livia Plurabelle” section can appreciate the *Wake*’s integral aural
component. Anyone appreciating Joyce’s penchant for bawdy limericks and coarse
double-entendre (such as naming a book of poetry, *Chamber Music*, after the
“music” of a chamber pot) can understand his link to unconventional music.

Roland McHugh’s *Annotations to Finnegans Wake* suggests a structural
relationship between Joyce's musicality and referentiality through its spatial
arrangement, such that each page resembles sheet music. My project, *Jail of
Mountjoy*, takes this sonic understanding one step further by "playing"
indicative sections of these annotations *as* music. This is accomplished
by aligning different categories of reference to respective octaves--e.g.
"Professional Jargon," "Linguistic [Taxonomic],” "Linguistic [Categorical],"
and so on. Then, sections are processed through a synthesizer to allow users
to hear both the level of linguistic depth and type of reference indicated,
while synchronized visual animations keep one situated in the text.
