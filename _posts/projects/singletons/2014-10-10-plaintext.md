The book is about the strange entanglement between humans, texts, and
machines. It examines key literary theoretical ideas alongside the
intellectual history of software engineering which frames modern reading,
writing, and interpretation practices. It is a deeply materialist work,
arguing that even our most ingrained intuitions about texts are profoundly
alienated from the contexts of their production. A new kind of poetics is
therefore necessary to preserve the free play of ideas implicit in the method
of humanistic inquiry.

As I write these words, a ceiling-mounted smoke detector in my kitchen emits a
loud noise every three minutes or so. And at every 15 minutes, a pleasant
female voice announces also "low battery." This is a precaution stipulated by
US National Fire Alarm Code 72-108 11.6.6 (2013). The clause requiring a
"distinct audible signal before the battery is incapable of operating" is not
only required by law, it is *encoded into the device*. The smoke detector
internalizes that piece of legislation in its programming. We thus obtain a
condition where the two meanings of code---as governance and machine
instruction---coincide. Code equals code.

I am at home, but I also receive a notification of the alarm on my mobile
phone. Along with monitoring apps that help make my home smarter, the phone
contains most of my book library. I often pick it up to read a book. However,
what I mean by "reading a book" obscures a number of metaphors for a series of
odd actions. The "book" is a small, thin black rectangle: three inches wide,
five inches tall, and barely a few millimeters thick. A slab of polished glass
covers the front of the device, where the tiny eyes of a camera and a light
sensor also protrude.  At the back, made of smooth soft plastic, we find
another, larger camera. At the foot of the device a grid of small perforations
indicate breathing room for a speaker and several microphones. To "open" a
book I touch the glass. The machine recognizes my fingerprint almost
instantly. I then tap and poke at the surface until I find a small image that
represents both my library and the book store, where I can "buy books." Buying
books does not actually involve ownership or books. Rather, I agree to a
licence that grants limited access to data, which the software then assembles
into something resembling a book on the screen. I tap again to begin reading.
The screen dims to match room ambiance as words fill the screen. One of the
passages on the first page appears underlined: a number of other readers in my
social circle must have found the passage notable. My finger slides along the
glass surface to turn the "page." The device emits a muffled rustle to
reinforce the pretense of manipulating paper. The image curls ever so slightly
in a way that resembles a printed page as another "page" slides into view. My
tiny library metaphor contains hundreds of such page metaphors.

Despite appearances, the electronic metaphor-making device next to my computer
has more in common with the smoke detector than it does with several paper
volumes scattered across my desk. The electronic book and the smoke alarm
contain printed circuit boards, capacitors, silicone chips, and resistors.
Both draw electric current. Both require firmware updates and both are
governed by codes, political and computational. The smoke alarm and the mobile
phone connect to the internet. They communicate with remote data centers and
with each other. And yet, I continue to read electronic books as if they were
familiar, immutable, and passive objects: just books. I think of them as
intimate artifacts---friends even---wholly known to me, comforting, and warm.
The electronic book is none of those things. Besides prose, it keeps my
memories, pictures, words, sounds, and thoughts. It records my reading,
sleeping, and consumption habits. It tries to sell me things, showing me
advertisements for cars, jewelry, and pills. It comes with a manual and terms
of service. It is my confidant, my dealer, my spy.
