## Updates
- Cleaned corpus and developed preliminary stopwords list for initial LDA model (October 2015)
- Compiled a test corpus for the time-signature project (August 2015)

## Literary Visualization Lab

The Literary Modeling & Visualization Lab is a project whose goal is to
re-think our approach to displaying and designing tools for exploring literary
data. Rather than simply making standalone, one-off maps, graph, or chart of a
novel, the literary visualization lab is interested in reading laterally
across multiple ways of visualizing and making navigable a text. Through these
iterative graphics, we draw on the rhetorical power of visualization in order
to illuminate the multiplicity of reading methods, practices, and ways of
navigating a text. In the gallery below are a series of projects that layer
different views on a text or set of texts.

### The Shape of Time

In a novel, time does not often move evenly or linearly–––a single paragraph in
García Márquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude* jumps several decades while in
Proust's *In Search of Lost Time*, 15 pages are devoted to a single moment of
eating a madeleine. In this project, we are interested in the kind of language
that used to talk about time and what is the shape and tempo of this language
in a given text. Tracking what we call the "time signature" of a text, we use
explicit references to time passing in order to divide up a text, and then use
probabilistic methods to analyze the relationships to the kinds of words that
cluster around changes in novel time and how these temporal patterns are
distributed in a text. We hope to explore how "time signature" offers a lens
into the location and duration of temporal language in a novel and how such
"time signatures" might be used to predict other aspects of a text such as
author, genre, format, and place of publication.

In the first phase, we have plotted our potential time anchors, parsing them
out by magnitude: year, month, day, hour. These two plots include samples of
18th and 19th century novels, and one visualization of the corpus of a
nineteenth century author, George Eliot. Building on this, we will use these
words denoting time passing to chunk the text in four different ways, and run
our model on these four different "chunkings" of the text.

### Mapping Indexicality

This project interprets the text of _The Arcades Project_ as a collection of
indexical gestures, reading instances of linguistic deixis as concretized
moments of textual interiority. According to Charles Sanders Peirce, the word
"this" is a certain type of index, which "calls upon the hearer to use his
powers of observation, and so establish a real connection between his mind and
the object." Within a textual setting, the word "this" takes on a different
kind of identity. Couched in a grammatical context, it becomes a marker of
intratextual reference and a signifier of its own position. It embodies
something close to a textual consciousness capable of remembering,
anticipating, and referring to itself.

Given the context-dependent meaning of deixis and the subjecthood implicit to
its operation, this project endeavors to track every instance of the word
"this" in _The Arcades Project_, classify the context of each instance along
distinct spatial and temporal axes, and visually represent each convolute as a
meandering path through time and space in a manner resonant with Benjamin's
description of the flâneur. The spatial movement evoked by the deictic
instance, along with the temporal movement represented in linguistic modality
and tense, forms the basis of each trajectory.
