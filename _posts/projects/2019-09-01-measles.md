As the United States is under threat of losing its Measles elimination status, this group
combines expertise in Medical Humanities and Natural Language Processing to understand the
cultural roots of vaccine hesitancy. By analyzing the literary tropes surrounding vaccination
in popular press and in medicine, we show how science and the perception of science are
continually shaped by metaphors, which persist within the medical imaginary.
