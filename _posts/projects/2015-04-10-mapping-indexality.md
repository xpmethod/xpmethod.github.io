This project interprets the text of _The Arcades Project_ as a collection of
indexical gestures, reading instances of linguistic deixis as concretized
moments of textual interiority. According to Charles Sanders Peirce, the word
"this" is a certain type of index, which "calls upon the hearer to use his
powers of observation, and so establish a real connection between his mind and
the object." Within a textual setting, the word "this" takes on a different
kind of identity. Couched in a grammatical context, it becomes a marker of
intratextual reference and a signifier of its own position. It embodies
something close to a textual consciousness capable of remembering,
anticipating, and referring to itself.

Given the context-dependent meaning of deixis and the subjecthood implicit to
its operation, this project endeavors to track every instance of the word
"this" in _The Arcades Project_, classify the context of each instance along
distinct spatial and temporal axes, and visually represent each convolute as a
meandering path through time and space in a manner resonant with Benjamin's
description of the flâneur. The spatial movement evoked by the deictic
instance, along with the temporal movement represented in linguistic modality
and tense, forms the basis of each trajectory.
