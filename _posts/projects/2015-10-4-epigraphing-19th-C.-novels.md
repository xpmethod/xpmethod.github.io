### Updates

1. Collected 7,689 epigraphs from 3,000 XML-encoded 19th-century US novels from the Early American Fiction and [Wright American Fiction](https://github.com/iulibdcs/tei_text) archives. (11 Oct 2015)

2. Newest version of [XML scraper](https://github.com/aaronplasek/19th_C._novel_scraper) collects a range of bibliographic and epigraphic information, and identifies novels that are potentially mistagged. (8 Oct 2015)

### Overview

Frequently ignored and occasionally made up, the epigraph is a textual genre defined both by its physical placement on the page and by the absence of the textual object being signposted. An epigraph attribution situates the text it prefaces within a larger constellation of texts and authors, and in this manner has an indexical function rather similar to scanning the spines of books on a shelf, flipping through a card catalog, or examining a record in a digital relational database. While in no way accepting that the affordances offered through the iterative construction of citation networks is ever a substitution for a critical method, a comparative approach to the different kinds of citations practices made visible by different networks of attribution provide an opportunity to reconsider how shared concepts that constitute a (disciplinary) field are produced, transmitted, and inhibited through our media-centric notions of consensus. From working with many 19th century novels, we know that the Bible and Shakespeare were frequently used as novel epigraphs, but little is known about who else was being quoted. Nor is anything known about the larger patterns of affiliation and citation assembled by these texts. 


### Calls for Participation

* Finding untagged epigraphs in TEI-XML Files  
    While epigraphs have been tagged in the XML by a human transcriber, there are certain novels in the digitized collection (such as James Fenimore Cooper's _Wyandotte_) that are mistagged [1,2]. Want some experience editing TEI? Have an algorithmic approach for tagging "rogue" epigraphs? Drop us a line!

* Name Disambiguation  
    There is little standardization of how names were spelled in 19th-century texts. (To wit, there are at least 8 spellings of Shakespeare.) Epigraph attributions formats are similarly unpredictable: separating titles (when present) from author names (when present) is a difficult algorithmic problem. Want to try out a clever "identity resolution" algorithm on a new data set? Our epigraph collection will be made open access shortly.
