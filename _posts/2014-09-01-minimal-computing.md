<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->
More than half of the world's population accesses the internet through a mobile phone.[^1] And yet, much of the academic practice in digital humanities and computational social sciences is aimed at bandwidth-heavy, visually complicated, high-performance vision of knowledge production. Embraced by eco-modders[^2] and by members of the GO::DH community[^3] alike, minimal computing is not just a model for the "developing world." It offers all the possibility of **human technology**, less shiny and more chaotic perhaps than big data or 3-D graphics, but also, in contrast, universally accessible, hackable, lasting, portable, and empowered.
