For more than two centuries Textual Scholarship have been based in print technologies: theories, methods, and practices aim as a final goal a final product fixed by ink. Digital Scholarly Editing and ePhilology has opened new paths of research and the field is increasingly broaden its digital theoretical implications. However, scholars are still constructing digital theories, and exploring digital practices. Each project proceeds in a different way, having in common sometimes just the encoding language. From the XPMethods we aim to experiment with digital practice for digital scholarly editing proposing new workflows. We believe that digital practice should work towards sustainability, scalability, minimal technology and infrastructure, reusability, and, especially as we consider it a research fundamental, reproducibility.
