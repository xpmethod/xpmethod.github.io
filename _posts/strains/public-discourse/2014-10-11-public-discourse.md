<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->
How does technology affect the ways in which we think of ourselves, talk to each other, and make decisions? Projects in this research cluster engage in the critical examination of ideas at the core of deliberative democracy: freedom of speech, participatory culture, and collective memory. These theoretical concerns manifest in the applied mechanisms of governance and citizenship, contesting, in practice, our commitment to the politics of privacy or surveillance, secrecy or transparency, preservation (as in the duty to remember) or entropy (as in, the right to be forgotten). Our (NYC-based) proximity to the worlds of journalism, library science, and publishing gives us an opportunity to affect meaningful change in redressing inequalities of access, to envision the **future of books and literacy**, and to experiment with new modes and new forums for discussion and communication.
