title: "Literary Modeling and Visualization Workshop"
location: Columbia University, Butler Studio 208b
type: workshop
prompt: "Bringing together researchers from different academic and national traditions, this workshop explores the limits and the possibilities of formal literary analysis."
categories: events

In collaboration between the Network for Digital Literary Studies, University of Southern
Denmark; Department of English and Comparative Literature, Columbia University; Group for
Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research; and Columbia University Libraries. Funded by the
Independent Research Fund Denmark.

After a discussion on the history of formal analysis on Tuesday we will recreate some of the
encountered studies on Thursday, using contemporary computational techniques. No prior
experience is required.

## About the network

Network for Digital Literary Studies unites people from four Danish research institutions and
is directed by associate professor Sofie Kluge (Department for the Study of Culture, University
of Southern Denmark).

In the field of literary studies, digitalization presents a whole array of exciting new
scientific perspectives. Firstly, it famously possibilities analysis of larger text corpora;
secondly, it makes possible the analysis of literary texts in a broader cultural field to which
social media, among other forms of communication, also belong; finally, it has clear pedagogic
and communicative advantages. Yet, although earlier skepticism has today been broadly replaced
by interest in the possibilities that digital methods and tools open up in literary research,
Danish literary scholars have not systematically pursued these possibilities nor has the
potential of digitalization to transform traditional literary scholarship been fulfilled. Much
less do existing digital tools and resources reach students of literature at Danish
universities.

Network for Digital Literary Studies unites Danish literary researchers with software
developers and international spearheads in order to 1) develop concepts for digital literary
research and 2) revise the central elements of traditional literary studies from the
perspectives opened up by digitalization.

In continuation of both these aims, our work is directed at developing concepts for digital
literary studies; presenting prototypes, pilot projects and cases for digital literary
research; and quality improving existing literary research projects with a digital profile.
