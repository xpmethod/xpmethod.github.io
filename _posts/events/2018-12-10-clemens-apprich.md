Clemens Apprich is visiting research fellow at the [Global Emergent Media
Lab](https://www.globalemergentmedia.com) at Concordia University in Montréal.

He will speak about his current research project, which examines the
reciprocity between paranoia and media. Building on the work started in his
previous monograph, [*Technotopia: A Media Genealogy of Net
Cultures*](https://web.archive.org/web/20181028190138/https://www.rowmaninternational.com/book/technotopia/3-156-79eda6dd-49eb-4b7e-8586-cc3c6263c729)
(Rowman 2017), Apprich employs the rich discourse around paranoia---ranging
from the history of psychiatry, film and literature studies, to media
theory---to explore the ‘sub-medial spaces’ which are all too often excluded
from our analysis of cultural, social and political practices in relation to
digital technologies.
