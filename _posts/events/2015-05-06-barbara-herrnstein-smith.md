## What Was “Close Reading”?

Since the 1940s, invocations of "close reading" (however understood) have figured centrally in controversies over new methodological developments in literary studies: e.g., the New Criticism, structuralism, New Historicism, deconstruction, ideology critique, and, notably now, the Digital Humanities. The talk will recall some of those controversies and consider how the idea or ideal of "close reading" operates in current debates about---and within---the Digital Humanities.

Event is free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served
