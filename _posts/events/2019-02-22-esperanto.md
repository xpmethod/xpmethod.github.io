Steve Eichblatt, a computational language analyst and esperantist, will present
his research in Esperanto text analysis.

Abstract: The International Language Esperanto is highly regular. Esperanto words are
constructed from unchangeable roots and affixes. This regularity enables a
straightforward computational study of the similarity of root words based
on the set of affixes which appear with them. Since root words map roughly
to concepts, we confirm that that similar concepts tend to be modified in
similar ways. It isn't always easy to guess which concepts are similar,
though, so there are some surprising results.
