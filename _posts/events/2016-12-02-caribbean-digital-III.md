Presenters will consider the affordances and limitations of the digital with
respect to a wide range of disciplines and methodologies. Discussions will
pick up themes addressed in our [2014 inaugural event][1], our focused
conversations at [last year’s colloquium][2], as well as in a special section
of [sx archipelagos][3], the peer-reviewed Small Axe Project publishing
platform dedicated to Caribbean digital scholarship and scholarship of the
Caribbean digital.

Please take the time to explore our site. For each of the conference panels,
our generous discussants have proposed differing “ways in” to their respective
sessions – some engage pointedly the specifics of panelists’ interventions,
while others evoke broader questions about the Caribbean (and the) digital. We
have placed these discussion questions below the panel abstracts.

Also plan to join us on Thursday, 1 December, 4-6PM at the Studio@Butler for
an information session and workshop devoted to multimedia mapping project In
the [*Same Boats: Toward an Intellectual Cartography of the
Afro-Atlantic*][4].

Can’t be here in person? Check us out via [live-stream][5]!
