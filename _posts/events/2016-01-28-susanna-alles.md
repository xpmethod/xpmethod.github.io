## A Digital Critical Edition for the *Vitae Illustrium Virorum* Project 

Susanna All√©s-Torrent, Lecturer in Digital Humanities at the [Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures](http://laic.columbia.edu/)

At the end of the XVth century the Spaniard, Alfonso de Palencia (1423-1492), chronicle of the Catholic Kings, translated all Plutarch's *Parallel Lives* from Latin into Spanish. All these biographies had been translated since the beginning of the Quattrocento by relevant Italian humanists from Greek into Latin; Palencia didn't know the Greek language and so he took advantage of these Latin versions, first published in Rome in 1470. We know for sure which edition he used to pursue his translation: it was the third edition published in Venice in 1478 by Nicholas Jenson. In this Plutarchian corpus there were also a set of biographies written originally in Latin by several intellectuals: the *Vita Aristotelis* by Leonardo Bruni, *Vita Platonis* by Guarino Veronese, *Vita Caroli Magni* and *Vitae Hannibalis et Scipionis* by Donato Acciaiuoli. 

This experimental project aims to offer a digital critical edition while exploring effective ways to present both textes synchronically, but mostly to create a collaborative infrastructure with a sustainable workflow based on sustainability, collaboration, open source and reusability. 


The prototype is still in its very beginning phase. You can find it here <http://susannalles.github.io/Vitae/index.html>, as well as the code source in GitHub: <https://github.com/susannalles/susannalles.github.io/tree/master/Vitae>
