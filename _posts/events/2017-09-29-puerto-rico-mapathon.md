**Columbia University Libraries** & **Columbia’s Group for Experimental
Methods in the Humanities** invites you to a Puerto Rico Mapathon
for relief efforts.

Come help with relief efforts on the ground in Puerto Rico by contributing
your time to open-source mapping.

No mapping experience necessary. No knowledge of local terrain is necessary.
Come any time during the afternoon. This [short video](https://mapgive.state.gov/learn-to-map/) can introduce you to the OSM mapping work

Please bring your laptop & RSVP to agil@columbia.edu
