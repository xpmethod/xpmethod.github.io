[Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) & The [Center for International History](http://cih.columbia.edu/) are proud to host:

Nepal Mapathon
for Earthquake Relief
May 7, 10-3 PM at Butler Library 208B

Come help with relief efforts on the ground in Nepal by contributing your time to open-source mapping.

Following the recent earthquake, people around the world are using the OpenStreetMap platform to give their time to earthquake relief efforts. [Kathmandu Living Labs](http://kathmandulivinglabs.org/), an organization in Nepal, has been working with relief organizations in urban and rural areas and updating mapping tasks on the [OSM Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) according to relief needs. During the mapathon, we will teach people how to help with these relief efforts through mapping and we will map together.

No mapping experience necessary. No knowledge of local terrain is necessary. Come any time during the day.

Please bring your laptop. RSVP [led2113@columbia.edu](mailto:led2113@columbia.edu).
