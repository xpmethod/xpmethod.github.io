## Representation and Non-linear Chronologies

Johanna Drucker, Breslauer Professor of Bibliographical Studies in the Department of Information Studies at UCLA, will join us for a discussion with Laura Kurgan, Associate Professor of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation here at Columbia.

Professor Drucker outlines her concerns:

> I am interested in modeling temporal relations without a standard Cartesian grid as the ground, finding a way to realize the unfulfilled project I began at \[The University of\] Virginia but couldn't realize because we did not have the technical ability. The manuscripts of [Eusebius's chronologies,](http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3804) for instance, float their relative time scales so they don't have to be reconciled within a single metric standard. Other aspects of humanistic representation of temporal experience are variable granularity and non-continuous temporality. The issues of non-linear, multi-directional, non-homogenous, and variably scaled temporalities are ones I have thought about for quite awhile.

This conversation will precede Johanna's lecture later in the evening, ["Should Humanists Use Information Visualizations?"](http://societyoffellows.columbia.edu/events/should-humanists-use-information-visualizations/) at the Heyman Center for the Humanities.
