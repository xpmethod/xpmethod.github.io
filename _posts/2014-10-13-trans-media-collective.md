<!-- A 75-100 word paragraph describing the motivation behind these projects -->

The Epistemic Action research cluster unifies our **advocacy and activism** efforts. We proceed
with the belief that certain theoretical commitments---deconstruction, decolonization, or
historical materialism---necessitate corresponding practical **engagement**. To be effective,
critique must be followed by concerted action. And action requires new modalities of
scholarship: critical making, workshops, tech training camps, community support, and legal
reform. Moderated by Professor [Durba Mitra][db], Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality
(Harvard) and [Madiha Choksi][mc] (Columbia Libraries).
