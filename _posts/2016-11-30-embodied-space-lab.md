Walking can be a mode of analysis that encompasses text, body, and place. The
*Embodied Space Lab* incorporates **mobile methods of reading and map-making**
into philology and historiography. In the dialectic between body and space we
trace apparent vectors of power, technology, gender, class, and ethnicity and
draw critical cartographies: ways of seeing and reflecting on an embodied and
embedded world. Moderated by [Manan Ahmed][ma], Department of History
(Columbia University).
