## Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) EUA Information

FDA expects the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) declared by the Department of Health and
Human Services under the Public Health Service Act to expire on May 11, 2023. The ending of the
COVID-19 PHE will not impact FDA's ability to authorize medical countermeasures for emergency
use. Existing COVID-19 EUAs will remain in effect, and the agency may continue to issue new
EUAs if the situation meets the criteria to do so. Read more about what happens to EUAs when a
public health emergency ends.
