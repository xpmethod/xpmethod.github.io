While much time has been spent theorizing the "digital" in Digital Humanities, the **On Method in the Humanities** series seeks to gain a greater understanding of the heritage and future of humanistic inquiry. In addition to traditional talks and presentations, the aim of the series is to stage productive encounters between theory and method, connecting top theorists and model-makers with makers of things, builders of code, and architects of the pixel.

In each encounter, we ask our guest to provide a brief (15-30 min) *prompt*, a problem, or a provocation. We will then meet, talk, imagine, and speculate as a group. Expect a discussion that flows into diagrams, maps, and word trees. These will be further refined into focused *experiments* that may take shape as physical artifacts or data, "white" papers, visualizations, robots, websites, manifestos, or circuit boards.

Lectures will examine the range of theoretical and practical methods used by humanities scholars and critics, past and present. Following Thomas Kuhn, how can we outline paradigms of humanistic inquiry? What are the national specificities of these methods? How are the technological challenges and opportunities provided by new research methods (computational, quantitative) and new organizational structures (labs, workshops, co-working) tethered to epistemological shifts as well?

This series is sponsored by the [Heyman Center for the Humanities](heymancenter.org), with support from [Columbia's Center for International History](cih.columbia.edu).
