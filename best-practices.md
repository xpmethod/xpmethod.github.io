Our lab strives to create an inclusive environment. Gender, race, and power remain vertices of encounter in academia. Aware of this, we ask that you be mindful of:

1. Architectures of power. Be mindful of the room’s physical arrangement. At the beginning of lab, long tables should be broken down into smaller islands of activity. Locations of power, like the lectern and should be systematically ceeded and inverted.

2. Polyglossia. Moderate your voice. For every word spoken make sure a mutliplicity of words are spoken by someone else.

3. Avoid over-explaining. There are plenty of structured learning. We want to facilitate peer learning. Delegate explaination to peers.

4. Economy of attention: Do not demand attention. Voices should be kept at a "cafe" setting, and conversations should move to various islands.

5. Provide Support. Reach out to new users of the space, introduce yourself, and help them acclimatize. Ask if they need support for their project-- connect them to peer users.
